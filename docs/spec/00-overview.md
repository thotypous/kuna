This chapter is the machinery every other chapter assumes: the two tiers and their
hand-off, the front-ends, the IR containers, the knowledge plane, the two
`Architecture` types, the pass scheduler, and the feedback edges that make the
pipeline non-linear. The algorithms themselves live in chapters 01–09; this is how
they are hosted, ordered, configured, and restarted.

The object-file bootstrap records an explicit ARM/Thumb input selection in
`Architecture::input_arm_isa_override`. This is an input fact, separate from
analysis options: metadata painters preserve it when discovery or graph/xref
commands revisit the code. Context precedence and decoder selection are
described in chapter 01, §1.3.

## 0.1 The two tiers

kuna is two engines with one boundary. The **program-preparation tier**
(`kuna-analysis`, chapter 01) looks at the whole binary once — loader parse, symbol
and relocation markup, strings, DWARF, entry discovery, the Listing, the no-return
family — and produces *facts*. The **decompiler tier** (`kuna-decomp`, chapters
02–09) analyzes one function at a time and never scans the program; everything it
knows about the outside world it reads from the knowledge plane (§0.4) that the
first tier populated. The analysis tier, symmetrically, never touches the
per-function IR.

(kuna) The hand-off is a three-step *stash → flags → gated commit* protocol, and
the order is load-bearing:

1. **Stash at load.** `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs
   (bootstrap_from_object)` opens the object, builds the engine, then runs every
   analysis pass read-only over the parsed image
   (`decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/src/passes.rs (run_default_analyses_per_pass)`).
   Nothing is committed: the per-pass facts — function/data symbols, discovered
   entries, no-return marks, no-fall-through call sites
   (`decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/src/pass.rs (AnalysisOutput)`) — are parked on
   the program keyed by pass id (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs
   (ConsoleProgram::pending_analysis)`).
2. **Flags.** The caller applies its `option` lines. Each analysis pass has an
   enable flag on the engine `Architecture` (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/architecture.rs
   (reset_defaults_internal)`, the `analysis_*` block), flippable per run.
3. **Gated commit at the read-symbols boundary.**
   `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/ifacedecomp.rs (IfcReadSymbols)` calls
   `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::commit_pending_analysis)`,
   which drains the stash, drops the facts of any disabled pass
   (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (analysis_pass_enabled)` — an
   unregistered id fails *open*, so a new pass runs by default unless it is
   output-changing and registers a default-off gate), merges the survivors in pass
   order, and installs them through
   `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (commit_analysis_output)`. Every
   commit arm is additive and idempotent against the loader symbols already
   installed *in the symbol table*: the discovered-entry arm's overlap check
   resolves **across scopes**
   (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/database.rs
   (Database::find_function_across_scopes)`, the port of C++ `Scope::queryFunction`,
   which spans the scope tree), so a function already known under a *namespaced*
   name is recognized as present and no placeholder is installed over it. Scoping
   that check to the global scope alone was the DIV-59 defect: a demangled C++
   funcsym lives in its namespace scope (`std::terminate` is base `terminate` in
   scope `std`), the synthetic `sub_<addr>` the arm would name a rediscovered entry
   carries no `::` and therefore resolves to GLOBAL, so the probe missed the real
   symbol and installed a duplicate beside it — and since the cross-scope resolver
   searches global first, that duplicate then shadowed the real name for
   `FlowInfo::queryCall`, rendering `sub_<addr>` at every C++ call site on any
   surface that enables a discovery pass. Idempotence does **not** extend to the
   flat name→address stream
   `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::register_symbol)`
   maintains: that retains by NAME, so an entry the loader already named
   accumulates a second record whenever a pass supplies a different name for it —
   a debug-info name (DWARF/PDB/pclntab/objc), a FID rename, or the generated
   `sub_<addr>` placeholder for a rediscovered entry. Several names for one entry
   is therefore the normal state, and §0.2 defines how the whole-binary surfaces
   collapse it.

   That stream (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (SymbolStream)`) is
   an insertion-ordered record list plus a name index, not a bare vector.
   Retaining by name as a rescan costs a full pass with a string compare per live
   record on every registration, and the analysis tier registers one symbol per
   discovered function, so the load is quadratic in the number of functions — and
   the generated `sub_<hex>` names all share a length and a prefix, so the length
   pre-filter never fires and a real byte compare runs at every visit. Registering
   a name instead tombstones that name's indexed records and appends the new one;
   iteration skips the tombstones and reports exactly the sequence a
   retain-and-append would, so the indexing is invisible to every consumer above.

Two pass families cannot run at load at all and are deferred *into* the commit:
the Listing walk and its consumers (the call-graph no-return fixpoint, §1.6–§1.7;
`decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/src/passes.rs (run_listing_consumers)`) and the
scalar-operand markup (`decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/src/passes.rs
(run_operand_refs)`). Both decode through the engine's SLEIGH translator, whose
program load-image is only attached after the load-time pass list runs — so
`commit_pending_analysis` re-parses the stashed image bytes and runs them at the
boundary, when their gates are finally known.

The failure mode of this protocol is silent: an analysis option applied *after*
the read-symbols boundary is a no-op — the facts were already committed or
dropped, and the drained stash means a second `read symbols` re-commits nothing.
Every driver therefore emits option lines strictly between `load file` and
`read symbols` (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all.rs (load_program)`,
`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile/script.rs (build_script_for_input)`).

The commit is also not transactional. Its arms mutate the architecture in place
and in order, so an arm that fails leaves the earlier ones applied and abandons
every later one — library and DWARF prototypes, processor-context paints,
tracked register values, call-fixups, stack locals, source-line comments — and
the drained stash makes it unretryable. A partial commit is therefore a *failed*
load, not a degraded one, and every surface says so and stops: the in-process
drivers propagate the error as `read symbols (analysis commit) failed: <reason>`,
and the subprocess driver recovers the same reason from the console transcript
and reports it identically (§0.2). Nothing about a partially-committed program is
visible in the C it would render, which is what makes reporting it — rather than
printing that C — the contract.

**Parity isolation.** The XML `<binaryimage>` bootstrap the datatests use
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (bootstrap_program)`) never runs
the analysis tier: nothing is stashed, so the gated commit is structurally a
no-op and the datatest parity oracle (`docs/baseline.json`) cannot be perturbed
by any analysis change. Only the real-object path pays for — or benefits from —
tier one.

## 0.2 Front-ends and the decompile-all walk

The public command names and handlers have one ordered table in
`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/main.rs`. Dispatch and the top-level help's
command list use that same table. Help integration tests discover the names
from the real CLI, reject empty or repeated entries, and exercise both help
spellings for every advertised command. Version/help aliases remain separate;
missing or unknown commands retain exit status 2 and diagnostics on stderr.

The CLI shares flag-value and option-pair consumption in
`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/args.rs`. Command-specific parsers retain their
flag sets and diagnostics; option names are validated before loading, and pairs
remain in argv order when forwarded from `decompile --json` to `decompile-all`.
Missing flag values make the parsers return a usage error (exit status 2)
immediately, without invoking the command engine.

String filtering is separate from inventory and reference attribution. The
private `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/strings/filter.rs (Regex)` module owns
the existing pattern grammar, case folding and bounded matching. A repetition
carries its node, limits and greedy/lazy policy together; ordinary and counted
quantifiers share suffix handling. Count parsing scans all ASCII digits before
checking the value, so overflow retains the same cursor and literal-brace
fallback behavior. Match-budget accounting and warnings remain unchanged.

The private `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all/callee_first.rs`
owns callee-first execution for whole-binary and project-export commands.
It applies the call-graph plan, runs caller-vote rounds and structure convergence,
parks eligible callbacks, then converges element globals. Results retain target
order. Each planned decompile copies the driver's output options and changes
only prototype parking; ledger resets, budgets and failed-redo handling remain
part of the same execution path. Loading and target selection stay in the parent
command module, while call-graph planning stays in `callgraph.rs`.

FID library ingestion deduplicates across inputs in
`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/fid.rs (dedup_records)`. Membership is keyed by
full hash, specific hash and borrowed name; a retain mask preserves input order
and the first record's metadata without cloning names. Different names or
specific hashes remain separate records. Database serialization and command
diagnostics are unchanged.

The database serializer visits full-hash buckets in ascending hash order and
retains insertion order within each bucket. Names are interned on first
encounter through one entry lookup, and repeated names reuse the same byte
offset. Both hash maps are private lookup indices; the serialization traversal
sets record and string-blob order explicitly. The flat format, version and
reader behavior are unchanged.

Archive-member loading is owned by
`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/fid/archive.rs`. Each object member is written to
a privately created temporary file whose guard removes it after loading or on
unwind. The writing handle is closed before the path-based loader opens it;
simultaneous ingests have independent member files. Non-object members are
still skipped, bootstrap failures retain the archive/member warning, and
record order and cross-input deduplication remain unchanged.

Text decompilation owns its C and optional region-output files for the entire
console run, including a discovery retry. Each file is privately created and
its initial writing handle is closed before launching the console. Scope exit
removes both files on success, error or unwind; file-creation failures return
a driver error before spawning the console. Script ordering, empty-output
handling and recovered pipeline diagnostics remain unchanged.

Inventory queries share function attribution and address records through
`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/function_info.rs`. Attribution prefers the
reference walk, then the engine's inventory. String and constant rows prefer
their canonical inventory names before entry, symbol and generated-name
fallbacks. Cross-reference queries retain their separate target/global-name
precedence but share the generated-name fallback and ordered function JSON
record. No query command depends on another command's implementation.

Browser smoke tests use `integrations/web/test/cdp-client.mjs` as a checked
process boundary: spawn, exit and port-deadline failures retain bounded stderr
diagnostics and clean up the owned profile. Availability skips remain the
caller's decision; a failed launch is not converted into a skip.

Four front-ends drive one engine assembly:

- **The console** — `decomp_dbg`
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/bin/decomp_dbg.rs`), the interactive
  command interpreter (`load file` / `read symbols` / `decompile` / `print C`),
  and the datatest harness `decomp_test_dbg`
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-harness/src/bin/decomp_test_dbg.rs`), which drives the
  same bootstrap over the XML corpus. This is the parity surface: it never arms
  the watchdog and (on the XML path) never runs tier one.
- (kuna) **`kuna decompile`** (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile/script.rs
  (build_script_for_input)`) — subprocess-per-function: it scripts a fresh `decomp_dbg` for
  each request, so every invocation re-parses the SLEIGH spec and re-runs the
  whole-binary analysis. It injects `option listing on` by default (unless the
  caller names `listing`), so the no-return analyses fire even on the
  single-function path. Its two selection forms resolve the printed function name
  the same way: `load function <name>` carries the requested name through, and
  `--addr <vma>` (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/ifacedecomp.rs
  (IfcAddrrangeLoad)`) first asks the symbol table what is installed at that
  address — across scopes, so a demangled C++ entry reports its qualified
  `Class::method` form — and only falls back to the generic
  `Architecture::name_function` (`sub_<addr>`) for a genuinely unknown address. An
  explicit `load addr <vma> <name>` still wins over both. Before DIV-59 the address
  form skipped the lookup entirely, so an addressed function on an **unstripped**
  binary printed a `sub_<addr>` header that the by-name form printed correctly.
  Because the engine runs in another process, this surface holds no error object:
  it recovers what failed from the transcript
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile.rs (check_errors)`), and does so to
  the same wording the in-process surfaces produce, so one failure reads the same
  from all four commands (DIV-90). A failed `load file` prints the escaped error
  and then `Could not create architecture`, so the reason is the line before the
  trigger; the generic `(unsupported/!recognized binary)` wording is only the
  fallback for a transcript that carried no reason at all. A failed analysis
  commit is an `Execution error:` the console prints while **keeping the session
  alive**, so `print C` still renders C and the command's exit code is the only
  thing left to distinguish a program whose debug facts were dropped from a
  binary that never had any: each console diagnostic is attributed to the command
  echo above it, and one belonging to `read symbols` is reported with the
  in-process surfaces' message and exit code rather than the C. A refused
  `option` line is read the same way and reported ahead of it (`option_failure`,
  below).
- (kuna) **`kuna decompile-all` / `kuna functions`**
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all.rs (run, decompile_all)`) — the
  whole-binary, machine-readable surface: load and analyze **once** in-process
  (`bootstrap_from_object` → options → `commit_pending_analysis`, i.e. the
  `load file` + `read symbols` seam inlined,
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all.rs (load_program)`), then loop
  `decompile_func_full_with_override_dyn` + `print_c` over every selected
  function. A failed function degrades to a per-function `error` record — the
  pipeline drive catches un-ported-seam panics, and the render/variable
  extraction is wrapped in its own `catch_unwind` so a printer invariant cannot
  discard the functions already decompiled. `kuna functions` is enumeration
  only, but it enumerates what `decompile-all` would decompile: both surfaces
  take the same driver discovery defaults, so on a stripped non-x86-64 binary
  the inventory is built with `funcstart_patterns`, `aif`, and the Listing that
  gates them, exactly as a whole-binary run is (DIV-68). What the inventory
  surface does not take is the Listing on an architecture where the Listing
  discovers nothing: on x86-64 it is the decompiling surfaces' default alone,
  because there it changes no-return facts and therefore emitted C, never the
  entry set. An explicit `--option`, and any preset that names one of these
  options, still wins on either surface.

  The full callable-symbol inventory these surfaces share is
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::function_entries_canonical)`,
  which yields **exactly one record per function entry address**, address-ordered.
  It exists because the raw symbol stream
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::function_entries)`)
  holds one record per NAME (§0.1), so without it a whole-binary run reports — and
  decompiles — the same function once per name it carries. Each record keeps the
  most informative name and carries the rest as aliases, ranked by
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (entry_name_rank)`: a real symbol
  outranks a synthesized dynamic-table name (`_INIT_<i>` / `_FINI_<i>` /
  `_DT_INIT` / `_DT_FINI`,
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (is_structural_entry_name)`), which
  outranks a generated placeholder
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (is_generic_placeholder_name)`);
  ties prefer the unprefixed spelling over the underscore-prefixed one, then the
  shorter name, then lexicographic order, so the choice is total and independent of
  symbol-stream order. Name-keyed selection resolves aliases too
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::find_entry_by_name)`),
  so collapsing the records never makes a name stop selecting its function.

  A name-keyed selection that matches nothing is then retried as the ADDRESS it
  spells, when — and only when — it is a name this build would MINT there
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::placeholder_name_address)`).
  The decision is made by minting rather than by parsing: the candidate offset is
  rendered in EVERY naming style — `sub_<addr>` (the default), `func_<addr>`
  (upstream) and `FUN_<addr>` (ghidra mode), the three arms of
  `Architecture::name_function` gathered by
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (minted_function_names)` — and
  accepted only if one of them comes back as the requested name, so a
  word-addressed space's scaling of the printed offset follows without parsing
  it. All three rather than only the ACTIVE one because `option namestyle`
  decides how a placeholder is PRINTED and a placeholder holds nothing but the
  address whichever vocabulary spelled it; matching one style made the styles
  disjoint name spaces, so a name taken from `kuna functions` — which reports the
  default style and takes no naming option — stopped selecting its function the
  moment a run asked for the other style, and the same binary answered
  `no function matches "sub_15dc"` while decompiling `func_0x000015dc` in full.
  The retry is additionally gated on the address holding
  mapped bytes — the numeric selector's own test — so a name resolved this way
  reaches exactly the function `--addr` on the same address reaches, and every
  other miss keeps its by-name `NotFound`. A binary that really does carry a
  symbol spelled like a placeholder is unaffected: the fallback runs only after
  the name match found nothing. This exists because a placeholder carries no
  information beyond the address while kuna prints them for entries the canonical
  inventory does not hold — a recovered tail call renders `sub_1170(a0)` at a
  call target that discovery folded into the enclosing function, and `kuna
  strings` names a literal's owner from the reference walk's own flow attribution
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/strings.rs (owning_function)`), which reaches
  starts the inventory never recorded — so the name kuna printed was one the
  by-name selector then refused.

  (kuna, issue #666) A second miss retry covers the ABI decoration the container
  applies to a C identifier. Mach-O stores `int main(void)` as `_main`, so the
  spelling a caller reads in the source is not a name the image carries at all,
  and `kuna decompile <macho> main` missed on an image whose symbol table held
  every name it needed. The decoration is a one-bit property of the container,
  read off its magic at bootstrap
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (bootstrap_from_object_with_isa)`
  → `ConsoleProgram::symbol_underscore_prefix`) rather than guessed from the
  names, so ELF, PE and COFF are untouched: an ELF that carries `_start` and not
  `start` still answers `start` as a miss. The name as GIVEN is tried first and
  the decorated spelling only after it found nothing, so an image carrying both
  `main` and `_main` resolves `main` to `main`. The retry is one-directional:
  a caller who types the decorated spelling has typed a name the image carries,
  and reading `_main` as `main` would invent a decoration rather than strip one.

  (kuna, issue #666) A miss that remains a miss reports what the image DOES
  carry, because the front-end cannot know. `EntryLookupError::NotFound`
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/entry_selector.rs`) carries two facts the
  selector model is the only thing in a position to state: the nearest spelling
  the image holds — the same identifier under a different leading-underscore
  decoration, never a merely similar name
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (nearest_spelling)`) — and how
  many entries carry a name the image supplied rather than one the engine minted
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (named_entry_count)`). Zero of
  the latter is the stripped image, where no name can select and only an address
  can; that, and only that, is what the CLI's "for a stripped binary pass an
  address with `--addr`" is the answer to
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile.rs (name_miss_hint)`). Before this,
  every by-name miss carried that sentence, so an unstripped Mach-O with all its
  symbols present was reported as stripped. On an
  ARM-family spec the grouping key folds away the Thumb mode bit (`vma & !1`, the
  same normalization
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project.rs (build_asm)` applies to its
  labels), so an `entry` and its `entry|1` twin are one entry; address-keyed
  selection folds it too
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::find_entry_at)`),
  so `--addr` on an odd ARM address reaches the function rather than decoding
  mid-instruction. Both folds are gated to ARM, where an odd symbol address is
  never an instruction boundary; elsewhere an odd address is genuine and is left
  alone. `kuna functions` and wasm `list` report this complete canonical
  inventory, including callable import pointer slots. Unfiltered
  `decompile-all`, `decompile-project`, and wasm whole-binary runs derive their
  default target set through
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::function_entries_executable)`:
  only entries inside a loader section carrying `CODE` are treated as function
  bodies. Import slots remain installed for call naming, prototypes, and generic
  symbol/address lookup. A decompiling selection adds a body check: a known IAT
  slot is refused instead of lifting its pointer bytes, even when its section is
  executable. A caller declaration overrides that classification when the image
  metadata is wrong. A
  loader that publishes no section metadata retains the complete canonical set.

  When a stub and its slot share a name, that same executability test settles the
  SELECTION rather than pruning the inventory
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::lone_executable_candidate)`,
  reached from both name lookups). A dynamically linked image spells an import's
  name on both the forwarding veneer a direct call targets and the IAT/GOT slot
  that veneer reads, so the name matches two entries and every by-name surface
  refused it: `kuna decompile <macho> strcmp` answered `selector "strcmp" is
  ambiguous` for all nine imports of a 26-entry inventory, while `disassemble`
  and `read`, which fall through to the raw symbol table when
  `find_entry_by_name` declines, answered at the pointer word instead — 78 names
  across the vendored PE fixtures listed the slot's bytes rather than the thunk's
  `jmp [slot]`. Exactly one candidate is executable, and it is the only one that
  can have a body, so that one is the answer. Pruning the data row would settle
  the ambiguity too and is wrong: a slot with no veneer — a `__DATA,__got` or
  `__DATA,__nl_symbol_ptr` word, an IAT entry a `call [slot]` reaches directly —
  is the only place its name appears at all, and on one measured Mach-O two of
  nine non-executable rows were lone. The narrowing therefore fires only where a
  veneer exists, and it requires EXACTLY one executable candidate: two
  same-named definitions in different code sections of a relocatable object are
  both executable and keep the ambiguity error, as does every candidate set on a
  sectionless image, where the test reads every address as executable.

  (kuna, issue #667) An ambiguity that survives that narrowing has to offer a
  selector the INPUT has. `.section+0xOFFSET` and `SECTION_INDEX:0xOFFSET`
  resolve against `object_sections`, which a relocatable load fills and a linked
  one leaves empty, so the unconditional "use a section-qualified selector" hint
  sent a caller to a form that could only answer `no function matches` there.
  `EntryLookupError::Ambiguous` therefore carries the same `relocatable` bit
  `Unmapped` already does: the section-qualified hint is for a relocatable
  input, and a linked image is given the address form, spelled out once per
  candidate so the answer is pasteable rather than a grammar to apply. The
  per-candidate line follows the same fact. A relocatable object's definitions
  and an undefined external really do sit at addresses kuna minted, and stay
  labelled `synthetic`; a candidate a linked image maps itself does not, and is
  reported at the address the program runs at. This is
  what makes Mach-O behave the way ELF already did by naming only the PLT stub.
  A **caller-declared** entry (the declared-extent plane below) is kept whatever the section flags say
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::is_declared_entry)`).
  The `CODE` test is a guess about where code lives, and a packer defeats it for
  free by not setting the bit: a NEOLite-packed PE flags all six of its sections
  `INITIALIZED_DATA|READ|WRITE`, `.text` included, so `--define-function
  0x4f7001-0x4f700c=entry` enumerated an 11-byte function that `kuna decompile`
  emitted a body for and that unfiltered `decompile-all` then dropped, answering
  `count: 0` with a null error. A declaration is an assertion rather than a
  candidate, so it outranks the filter; nothing undeclared is lifted with it, and
  the filter is unchanged for every image whose flags mean what they say.

  (kuna) **The run-level discovery verdict is read off that same executable set,
  never off the canonical inventory.** An unfiltered run that found no function
  is reported as the failure it is — non-zero exit, the reason on stderr and in
  the document's `error` field — and the question "found no function" has to mean
  *no body*, because the canonical inventory retains import pointer slots for
  call naming and an image can consist of nothing else. The reported NEOLite PE
  enumerates six imported Win32 names at its Import Address Table and no body at
  all, so `decompile-all` named the cause while `kuna functions` and `kuna
  functions --summary` answered `count: 6` with a null error and exit 0 — the
  packed-image diagnosis the caller can act on, withheld from the two surfaces an
  agent orients with first. All three now ask
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::any_executable_entry)`,
  which is `function_entries_executable` decided over an inventory already in
  hand: one section-table walk, no second enumeration. The six names stay in the
  listing beside the error, because a name the packed stub is going to call is
  the answer for that file. A declaration is still what clears the verdict: one
  declared body makes the run a run.

  (kuna) **The native decompile verdict is also read after the selected functions
  run.** Selection succeeded and individual failures were isolated, but a non-empty
  result set with no `FuncResult::code` body is not a usable decompilation. The shared
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project.rs (BatchOutcome)` classifier makes
  `decompile-all` and both `decompile-project` writers report that state as a
  run-level error. This is an aggregate verdict, not fail-fast: all text/JSON records
  and all project artifacts are finished first; one body keeps a mixed batch at exit
  zero and every failed function remains its own error record. A streamed all-failed
  export is complete rather than interrupted, so it finalizes the README and
  `index.jsonl`, removes `.streaming`, then returns exit one. An empty narrowed
  selection has no result set and remains an ordinary filter answer.

  Explicit selection of an entry with **no mapped bytes** — a relocatable
  object's undefined symbol bound to a synthetic extern-area address
  so that calls to it render by name — answers with the entry's nature rather
  than with the lifter's byte-load failure: the shared decompile step probes
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::entry_bytes_mapped)`
  first and emits a one-line external-symbol body. The console performs the same
  check before following flow and reports
  `Selected entry is an undefined external symbol` only for entries with
  `UndefinedExternal` provenance. The text CLI recognizes only that diagnostic
  as an external. A named XML symbol outside its byte chunks still fails with
  `Selected entry has no mapped bytes`; a later byte-load error while decoding
  a mapped entry also remains a failure, as it does in JSON output. Because that
  probe reads through the loader's 512-byte staging window, an unmapped address
  just past mapped bytes can pass it; on a `mappedflowboundary` image it then
  fails in the checked decode with `Instruction bytes at <addr> are not mapped`,
  while an address far from any segment is refused by the CLI selector with
  `address <addr> is not mapped in this input`. A PE IAT slot
  is different:
  its pointer bytes are mapped, so body selection consults the loader's import
  ranges and returns a non-success diagnostic naming the import and slot before
  flow following starts. The mapped-byte probe remains a one-byte read
  rather than a section-flag test, so an address that is mapped but outside any
  `CODE` section (packed code in `.data`, a hand-picked `--addr`) decompiles
  exactly as before. The browser inventory sorts the same entries into its
  imports-and-thunks group off that predicate
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/classify.rs`), which a name test cannot
  do: loader names are demangled (`CellClass::Cell_Coord`) and symbol-table names
  are not. That classifier sits beside the shared decompile-project core rather
  than in either front-end because two surfaces answer "what kind of function is
  this" — the browser inventory and the `kuna decompile-graph` document (§9.7) —
  and they must not answer it differently.

  (kuna) **The listing surfaces read the same section flags to choose a view.**
  `kuna disassemble` and its `kuna read` spelling
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/disassemble.rs (render)`) are one command with
  two renderings of one walk: decoded instructions, or the bytes as a hexdump
  with an ASCII gutter and, under `--json`, the span as one contiguous hex
  string. `--as code|data|auto` selects, and `auto` — the default for
  `disassemble`, where `read` defaults to `data` — decides from the loader's own
  classification of the section holding the start address
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/disassemble.rs (decide_view)`): a section
  carrying `DATA` without `CODE`
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-sleigh/src/loadimage.rs (section_flags)`) holds bytes,
  so it is shown as bytes. Two exceptions keep the inference honest. A target that
  resolved to a discovered function entry is code wherever it was linked, so it is
  never reclassified; and an address in no section the loader published — the XML
  `<binaryimage>` corpus, a raw blob — is silence rather than evidence and keeps
  the instruction listing. Only an inferred flip is explained, on stderr and in
  the JSON `notes`, so `--json` stdout stays one document; an explicit `--as` is
  the caller's decision and is not narrated back at them. This exists because the
  instruction view alone is a wrong answer that reads like a right one: `.rdata`
  and `__TEXT,__const` decode perfectly well into `ADD`/`OR` rows that describe
  nothing in the program, which is what sent two RE-loop testers to `xxd` and
  `objdump -s` (`docs/re-needs/cli-mode-read-raw.md`).

  (kuna) **A listing names the branch targets it decoded across, and `--follow`
  decodes from them.** A straight-line walk assumes every byte in the range
  starts an instruction or is inside one; hand-written and obfuscated code breaks
  that deliberately, and the resulting listing is not merely short a row — it
  spells calls and out-of-image jumps the bytes do not contain. So every code
  listing reports the addresses its own instructions branch or call to that no
  row of it starts at (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/disasm.rs
  (skipped_targets)`), on stderr and in the JSON `notes`. The evidence is the
  listing's own: the fixed flow targets already harvested for the literal-pool
  fold (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (FixedRefs)`), restricted to
  the listed span, because a branch out of the range says nothing about the range.
  `--follow` (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/disasm.rs (follow_rows)`) then
  decodes from those addresses as well as from the start, to a fixpoint over
  whatever the newly decoded rows themselves name: one re-anchor is not enough,
  because the instruction at a jumped-to address is commonly another jump over
  another decoy byte. A run steps forward while the instruction has a
  fall-through successor — the `xref_control_flow` last-op rule
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (FixedRefs::harvest)`), where a
  `goto` whose destination is the instruction's own fall-through is not a dead
  end, since SLEIGH gives the x86 `E8 00000000` get-PC idiom its own `goto`
  constructor — and stops where an earlier run already claimed the bytes, so no
  address is decoded twice and the fixpoint terminates. What flow never reaches is
  then filled by the ordinary straight-line walk between the claimed rows, clipped
  so nothing crosses into one, which is why `--follow` never lists less than the
  plain listing and both cover the same span. It is off by default because it
  costs a second walk and the straight line is the right answer for compiler
  output (`docs/re-needs/linear-disassembly-silently-skips.md`).

  (kuna) **A window the caller bounded is answered without the discovery walk.**
  `--count`, `--bytes` and an explicit `start-end` range each bound the listing on
  their own (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/disassemble.rs
  (window_is_caller_bounded)`), so such a target does not need the program-wide
  function inventory the whole-binary driver defaults build. It is loaded once
  with the analysis tier's two discovery gates — `listing` and `fast_funcdisc` —
  turned off (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/disassemble.rs
  (windowed_options)`), unless the caller named either option, in which case their
  word stands. The walk is deferred, not dropped: the inventory reaches a bounded
  listing through exactly two values, the target's name and whether it resolved to
  an entry, so the windowed answer is kept only when the program named the target
  from a fact it already held AND the view it chose does not depend on there being
  an entry at that address (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/disassemble.rs
  (windowed_answer_is_final)`). Anything else — a name only discovery invents, an
  address only it knows, a bare address in a data section — reloads with the full
  bundle and answers exactly as it did before, which is what keeps `kuna
  disassemble sub_1190` from becoming the "no function matches" regression
  `docs/re-needs/analysis-generated-function-name.md` records. A listing whose
  length is the function extent is never bounded by the caller, so it always takes
  the full walk. The motive is that the walk is priced by the image, not by the
  request: `--mode auto` selects `fast` from 2 MiB up, whose retained
  `fast_funcdisc` pass decodes every executable byte, and on a 9.4 MB PE that is
  99.4% `.text` printing 40 instructions cost 20.1 s
  (`docs/re-needs/disassembling-40-instructions-takes.md`).
- **`kuna_ghidra`** (`decompiler/crates/kuna-ghidra/src/bin/kuna_ghidra.rs`) —
  the ghidra-mode process front-end: the stock Ghidra GUI spawns it as its
  decompiler core and talks the burst-framed stdin/stdout protocol
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-ghidra/src/protocol.rs`). No `.sla` is loaded in this
  mode; every instruction's p-code, every byte, symbol, and type arrives by
  callback query (`decompiler/crates/kuna-ghidra/src/client.rs`).
  `registerProgram` builds a live engine `Architecture` over the query-backed
  translator (`decompiler/crates/kuna-ghidra/src/process.rs`,
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-ghidra/src/translate.rs (GhidraTranslate)`), and
  `decompileAt` drives the real `decompile_func`, its providers issuing nested
  queries on the still-open command response
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-ghidra/src/provider.rs (SharedClient, GhidraLoadImage)`).
  A decompile failure degrades to the incomplete-function response shape so the
  GUI never desyncs.

  (kuna) **The Phase-3 lazy providers** make ghidra-mode consume the program
  facts the host already has. The wire has no enumerate-the-program query, so
  eager pre-population (what the console's analysis commit does) is impossible;
  kuna instead ports upstream's lazy `ScopeGhidra` model to the seams its own
  pipeline reads. `RemoteScope`
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/remote_provider.rs`) is installed on
  the `Architecture` at registerProgram (after the cspec `<global>` ranges and
  pspec property paints are in — the `lockDefaultProperties` point) and rides
  every per-function `ArchContext`; when present, every global-scope read
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/context.rs
  (ArchContext::effective_global_query)`: properties, global names/types,
  containers, callee prototypes, deindirect resolution) and the flow
  environment's callee name / no-return queries
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs (ArchFlowEnv)`)
  resolve through it. A miss inside a cspec `<global>`-ranged space fires ONE
  getMappedSymbols query; the `<doc><mapsym>` answer decodes through the
  symbol-family decoder (`decode_mapped_answer`: `<symbol>`, `<function>` with
  its `<prototype>` and `<localdb>` category-0 parameters, `<functionshell>`,
  `<labelsym>`, `<externrefsymbol>`, `<equatesymbol>`, `<facetsymbol>`) into
  `GlobalEntry` records merged over the Database snapshot; a `<hole>` answer
  lands in a negative-cache range list (never re-queried) and its
  readonly/volatile bits paint a local property map that `clear()` rolls back
  to the locked default. Namespace ids resolve once through getNamespacePath.
  A decoded LOCKED signature (typelocked params or a locked-void input) parks a
  `TypeCode` prototype for `query_callee_proto` plus `PrototypePieces` for
  `ActionDefaultParams` and — for the current function — seeds the fresh
  `Funcdata`'s prototype at `decompileAt`, whose display name now comes from
  the mapsym answer (the Java `Function.getName()` echo), getCodeLabel demoted
  to fallback. The decoded `<function noreturn>` fact truncates flow at
  no-return call sites, exactly as the console's analysis facts do.
  Types: registerProgram decodes the wire `<coretypes>` (so kuna's core-type
  ids equal the host's), and a `find_by_id` miss fetches the definition with
  getDataType (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/dtype.rs
  (decode_type, decode_core_types, find_by_id_or_remote)`); composites intern
  an incomplete stub before their fields decode so a self-referential struct
  cannot re-query forever. Comments fill once per flush cycle from getComments,
  filtered by the printer's comment settings (an empty filter issues no query).
  Registers resolve through a query-backed lookup installed on the ghidra-mode
  space manager (`decompiler/crates/kuna-ghidra/src/translate.rs
  (GhidraRegisterLookup)`) — the mirror of the Sleigh's own installed lookup,
  without which the naming pass misclassifies every register-storage high as
  global data and the output leaks raw `EAX`-style tokens. The pspec
  `<tracked_set>` (e.g. x86-64's `DF = 0`) decodes into the engine trackbase in
  ghidra mode too (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/architecture.rs
  (decode_ghidra_tracked_sets)`), resolving register names through the
  query-backed translator, so `ActionConstbase` plants the direction seed.
  Because that lookup is a host query, an undefined name is not a local miss:
  Ghidra's callback throws `No Register Defined`, which the host logs as an
  `Unexpected Exception` with a stack trace before the exception frame ever
  reaches kuna — recoverable on the wire, but visible to the user and
  unsuppressible from this side. So a *speculative* by-name lookup — a pass
  asking "does this language happen to have register X?" rather than resolving
  a name the host itself supplied — must go through the probe seam
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-base/src/space.rs (RegisterLookup)`'s
  `probe_register` and `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/engine_translate.rs
  (EngineTranslate)`'s `probe_register_varnode`) instead of the exact lookup.
  Both default to the exact lookup's `Ok`-to-`Some`, so the standalone Sleigh
  path is unchanged; the ghidra translator overrides them to answer from the
  `nm2addr` cache alone and issue no query. A `None` therefore means "not
  resolvable here", never "this language has no such register" — which is why
  only speculative tests may consult it. The x86 direction-flag assertion
  (chapter 04) is the case this shapes: its `DF` probe still resolves in ghidra
  mode because the pspec `<tracked_set>` sweep above runs first and caches `DF`,
  and every stock x86 pspec carries that set.
  The same absence of a local `.sla` leaves every p-code INJECTION payload
  without a compiled template. Registration still happens — the cspec
  `<callfixup>`/`<callotherfixup>` names, their `incidentalcopy`/`paramshift`
  flags and their parameter lists all decode as usual, and the passes that read
  that metadata are unaffected — but the snippet bodies are never compiled, so
  the two template consumers
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs (emit_inject)`)
  fall through to a second translator seam
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/engine_translate.rs
  (EngineTranslate)`'s `fetch_inject_pcode`). The ghidra translator answers it
  with a getPcodeInject query carrying the live injection context — base
  address, call address, and the sized input/output operand lists, with the
  follow-on address deliberately omitted because the host re-derives it — and
  streams the response straight into the emitter. What comes back is p-code the
  host has ALREADY LIFTED against that context: the ops are stamped with that
  call site's address and bound to that site's storage, so it is not a reusable
  template and must never be cached — two queries for the same payload name
  legitimately differ. A host exception on the query becomes a low-level error
  naming the payload rather than a passed Java exception, so a payload the host
  cannot supply costs that one function and not the whole command. On the
  standalone path the template always exists and the seam is unreachable. The
  reach is wide: `ARM.cspec` and all nine vendored MIPS cspecs declare a
  `setISAMode` `<callotherfixup>` that every interworking branch raises, so
  without the fetch most functions of both architectures fail outright in
  ghidra mode.
  External references resolve through the upstream two-step
  (`ScopeGhidra::resolveExternalRefFunction`): the `<externrefsymbol>` answer
  keeps its resolve address, getExternalRef fires at the POINTER address, the
  returned function materializes at its own entry, and the pointer symbol
  types as pointer-to-code.  A function answer's RAW name and its `label` stay
  SPLIT (the upstream `Funcdata` name/displayName pair): the raw name is the
  Funcdata identity `HighFunction.decode`'s name echo compares against, the
  label only ever prints (`Funcdata::set_display_name`).  The host's
  per-address tracked registers arrive for real: decompileAt issues
  getTrackedRegisters at the entry (`RemoteScope::tracked_at`, cached until
  flush) and merges the answer OVER the pspec `<tracked_set>` defaults —
  wire values win per register.  A wire/decoder failure inside a lazy query
  negative-caches the address as a one-byte hole for the flush epoch and
  surfaces ONE "Warning:"-prefixed 16/17 line (`RemoteScope::drain_warnings`)
  instead of re-querying unboundedly.  setOptions follows the upstream
  reset-then-apply contract (`Architecture::reset_wire_defaults` + the DIV-77
  preset layer before every decode) because Java delta-encodes the list.
  ghidra-mode also prints a `Kuna v…` plate comment (the release
  `KUNA_VERSION` bake, `kuna_banner_text`) at the top of every function —
  cache-only, HEADER-typed, rendered by the printer's plate arm
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p9_emit/printc.rs
  (emit_comment_func_header)`), which also renders the host's PLATE comments;
  the standalone pipeline never inserts HEADER comments, so that arm is inert
  there.  `flushNative` clears it all in the upstream order
  (`Architecture::flush_remote_caches`): symbol cache + property rollback +
  the tracked cache, non-core types (`TypeFactoryImpl::clear_noncore`),
  comments, decoded strings.
  `setOptions` decodes the `<optionslist>` for real through
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/options.rs (decode_lenient)`
  — every known option applies, unknown elements are skipped whole with a
  "Warning:"-prefixed 16/17 line (DIV-76), and the command always answers `t`.
  registerProgram also applies the CLI `aggressive` ENGINE-TIER preset (the
  GUI has no `--mode` surface) and flips address-derived fallback naming to the
  Ghidra GUI convention `FUN_`/`DAT_`/`LAB_` (DIV-77) via
  `Architecture::kuna_name_style` — kuna's angr-style local naming stays on.
  None of this touches the standalone path: no provider installed means every
  seam takes its frozen-snapshot branch, byte-identically.

  (kuna) **The Phase-4 full response encode** makes the `decompileAt` answer
  carry everything the native GUI features consume, in the upstream child
  order (`Funcdata::encode`,
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata_encode.rs`): the base
  `<addr>`, the `<localdb>` symbol scope, the `<ast>` (savetree), the
  `<highlist>` (savetree + high-level on), the `<jumptablelist>`, and the
  `<prototype>`.  `<localdb>` is `ScopeLocal::encode`
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p6_variables/varmap.rs`) over the
  function's private symbol database
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/database.rs
  (Database::encode_scope, Symbol::encode_header, SymbolEntry::encode)`):
  every `<symbol>` carries its NONZERO id (internal `SYMBOL_ID_BASE`-range for
  kuna-invented symbols; Java's `HighSymbol.decodeHeader` throws on 0), every
  `<mapsym>` at least one storage entry (`<addr>`/`<hash>` + its uselimit
  `<rangelist>`), parameters their `cat=0` + slot `index` + exact storage (the
  Java rename path re-commits the whole signature when these disagree with the
  database), and the `<scope>` opens positionally with `<parent>` +
  `<rangelist>` because `LocalSymbolMap.decodeScope` skips both blind.
  Because kuna's naming pass binds plain strings (`kuna_name`) instead of the
  C++ `ActionNameVars::linkSymbols` Symbol objects, two mechanisms supply the
  ids the wire needs. First, the naming pass RECORDS the bind it actually made
  (`HighVariable::kuna_link_symbol`,
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p6_variables/coreaction_cleanup.rs`) when
  a high resolves to a covering localmap entry — and, for a `&symbol`
  REFERENCE, the identity of the Symbol referred to
  (`HighVariable::kuna_ref_symbol`, set by `Funcdata::link_symbol_reference`,
  the port of C++ `Varnode::setSymbolReference` →
  `HighVariable::setSymbolReference`). That second record is what a stack
  aggregate reached ONLY through `&sym` — a `char v [16]` passed to `memcmp`,
  whose entire HighVariable is the constant `PTRSUB` offset operand and which
  therefore owns no storage to re-derive a Symbol from — is declared off; it is
  read for the declaration only, because such a high encodes
  `class="constant"`, where Java's `HighConstant.decode` does nothing with a
  mapped local symref. Second, an encode-time link
  pass (`Funcdata::kuna_link_high_symbols`) gives every REMAINING named high a
  **wire-only symbol**
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/database.rs (WireSymbol)`):
  a mapped one at its storage when nothing covers it, or — when a Symbol does
  cover the storage yet the naming pass declined the bind as a CONFLICT (the
  narrower addr-tied return over a wider scalar parameter; the float8 lane over
  a float4 param) — a data-flow-HASHED one, upstream's `buildDynamicSymbol`
  answer. The encode never re-derives a container binding itself: doing so
  would hand a conflict-separated high the parameter's id, and a rename from
  that variable's token would rename the parameter. Wire symbols are encoded
  into `<localdb>` and referenced by `<high symref>`, but never enter the
  analysis scope — which is what lets the pass run BEFORE the markup is
  printed (so `<vardecl symref>` carries the same ids) without changing a byte
  of the emitted C. The `<highlist>` (`Funcdata::encode_high`, the
  `HighVariable::encode` port: `repref` = name-representative create-index,
  the five-way `class` rule, `symref` + partial `offset`, the type reference,
  one instance `<addr ref>` per member) therefore points only at ids the
  just-encoded `<localdb>` resolves — a symbol the encode skipped defensively
  is withheld from `symref` too (`Database::encodable_symbol_ids`, and
  `WireSymbol::is_encodable` for the wire ones: a 0-sized data-type at MAPPED
  storage is the `MappedEntry.decode` throw, so such a high takes the hashed
  shape instead), because an orphan reference is the Java hard-throw the skip
  exists to avoid.  The markup's `<vardecl symref>` passes the SAME filter and
  falls back to the create index when it fails — an unresolvable declaration
  reference is not a throw (`ClangVariableDecl.decode` logs and returns) but it
  is a dead rename on that line, which is the whole point of the attribute.
  Globals echo the REAL host database id delivered by
  getMappedSymbols (`GlobalEntry::symbol_id`,
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/context.rs`) and NEVER a
  fabricated one — an unknown id omits `symref` (Java warns and falls back to
  address-keyed rename) rather than silently renaming the wrong symbol.  Type
  references marshal through the `Datatype::encode_ref` port (chapter
  [05](05-types.md)); the prototype through `FuncProto::encode` (chapter
  [04](04-calls-and-prototypes.md)).  The `<jumptablelist>` re-uses the ported
  `JumpTable::encode` and is emitted INDEPENDENTLY of savetree — the switch
  analyzer asks `noc`+`notree`+`jumpload` and consumes only this list; the
  session's jumpload toggle reaches recovery as the upstream
  `FlowInfo::record_jumploads` flowoptions bit, applied per-decompile in
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-ghidra/src/process.rs` so the setOptions baseline
  reset can never strand it.  Under action `paramid` with parammeasures on,
  the doc contains ONLY `<parammeasures>`
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/paramid.rs
  (ParamIDAnalysis::encode)`, the `<rank>` child always on — Java throws
  without it); otherwise an optional `<parammeasures>` precedes the function
  pair.  The markup `<function>` is rendered BEFORE `fd.encode` runs (the
  link pass must not perturb the printed C) and spliced after the syntax tree,
  keeping the upstream document order.
  The rename/retype PERSISTENCE loop closes the circle: a GUI edit is a DB
  write (`HighFunctionDBUtil.updateDBVariable`) followed by an event-driven
  re-decompile whose getMappedSymbols answer now carries the edited local in
  the function's `<localdb>` (Java `LocalSymbolMap.grabFromFunction`).  kuna
  decodes those non-parameter locals
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/remote_provider.rs
  (RemoteLocalVar)`) and seeds them into the fresh `Funcdata` along FOUR
  channels, chosen by the two bits Java sets — the storage class and the
  typelock:
  a mapped, TYPELOCKED local (a retype — Java sends `typelock=false` only for
  `Undefined` types) seeds as a real mapped/usepoint symbol
  (`Funcdata::seed_mapped_symbols` / `Funcdata::seed_usepoint_symbols`,
  surviving restructure's typelock-keep rule); a mapped, namelocked-only local
  (a plain rename) — which C++ itself never keeps as a Symbol — stages as a
  NAME RECOMMENDATION (`Architecture::kuna_pending_name_recs` →
  `Funcdata::seed_name_recommendations`), the `ScopeLocal::nameRecommend`
  mechanism of chapter [06](06-variables-and-merge.md) §6.4; and the same two
  cases in DYNAMIC (`<hash>`) storage — the class Java writes for every
  variable that `requiresDynamicStorage`, i.e. unique-space representatives and
  `splitOutMergeGroup` products — seed as a dynamic Symbol
  (`Funcdata::seed_dynamic_symbols`) or a DYNAMIC name recommendation
  (`Architecture::kuna_pending_dyn_recs` →
  `Funcdata::seed_dynamic_recommendations`, applied through
  `DynamicHash::find_varnode` by
  `Funcdata::kuna_apply_dynamic_recommendations`).  Dropping the hash-storage
  half would silently revert renames of exactly the register/temporary
  variables users rename most.  The host's declared prototype MODEL and its
  EXACT committed parameter storage ride along too
  (`Architecture::kuna_pending_proto_model`,
  `Funcdata::apply_locked_prototype_with_model`, and the decoded cat-0
  storage threaded into `Funcdata::apply_mapped_params`, whose slots are
  counted in the SAME compacted basis `RemoteProto::to_pieces` builds).  The
  storage echo is the load-bearing half: Java's `checkFullCommit` compares the
  parameter COUNT, each `categoryIndex`, and each storage — never the model
  name — so a kuna-rederived storage or a slot skew force-rewrites the user's
  signature on the next rename.  The model rides along because the storage kuna
  would otherwise derive comes from it, not because Java inspects it.  Those
  echoed pieces carry the `ParameterPieces` lock bits (`TYPELOCK|NAMELOCK`),
  never the same-named `varnode_flags` ones — the two namespaces share no bit,
  and `apply_mapped_params` re-`setParam`s each slot WHOLESALE after the
  prototype channel has already locked it, so unlocked pieces here silently
  unlock the whole signature (`FuncProto::isInputLocked` reads slot 0's
  typelock) and the host's declared types and names get re-derived instead of
  applied.

(kuna) **Locating the engine and the specs.** Two installations are first class
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/paths.rs (binary, specs_dir)`), and neither is
derived from the other. In a checkout `kuna` is built to
`<root>/decompiler/target/[<triple>/]<profile>/kuna`, so the repo root is the
directory above the `decompiler`/`target` pair and `specs/` sits under it. In an
extracted release archive `kuna`, `decomp_dbg` and `slacomp` are siblings in one
directory, the separately downloaded `specs/` tree is beside or inside it, and
there is no repo root at all — popping three parents off the archive directory
lands on a path that exists nowhere, so the pop is refused rather than reported.
Each binary probe tries the bare name and then the platform's executable suffix,
because the Windows archive ships `decomp_dbg.exe` and `Path::exists` applies no
suffix of its own. The environment overrides (`KUNA_ROOT`, `KUNA_SPECS`,
`KUNA_DECOMP_DBG`, `KUNA_DECOMP_TEST`, `KUNA_SLACOMP`, `KUNA_RUST_PROFILE`, all
documented in `docs/cli.md`) win over both layouts. A probe that finds nothing
names the directories it looked in: the in-tree path a checkout would have built
to is not an answer on a machine that has no checkout, and a missing SLEIGH tree
is reported where it is resolved rather than as the engine's downstream
`No sleigh specification` — which reads as a problem with the binary.

`kuna specs --diff` is informational: it writes verification guidance without
starting a compiler (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/specs.rs (run)`). It identifies
pinned Ghidra compiler element-stream comparisons separately from decompiler
behavioral assertions; neither substitutes for the other.

(kuna) **Compiler filenames.** The single-file `slacomp` command accepts one input
and at most one output filename. It appends `.slaspec` or `.sla` when the filename
has no extension; dots in parent directories do not count. Explicit matching
suffixes, including the filenames `.slaspec` and `.sla`, are accepted unchanged,
while other filename extensions are rejected. With no output argument it writes
the input's sibling `.sla`. Extra positional arguments fail before compilation.
Both filename arguments use the same normalization rule
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-slacomp/src/bin/slacomp.rs (with_extension)`).

The compiler's `-y` flag selects the XML debug encoding in both single-file and
recursive (`-a`) modes. After successful parsing and compilation, the driver
chooses the XML encoder or the default compressed binary encoder according to
that flag; filename selection and write-error handling are the same in both
modes (`decompiler/crates/kuna-slacomp/src/slgh_compile.rs (run_compilation)`,
`decompiler/crates/kuna-slacomp/src/encode.rs (encode_to_xml_bytes)`).
The symbol and constructor encoding path retains the `OpcodeEncoder` interface
so each encoder chooses its own opcode representation: names in XML, signed
integer values in binary. Treating every encoder as binary would produce numeric
XML attributes where Ghidra expects names
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-sleigh/src/sleighbase.rs (encode)`,
`decompiler/crates/kuna-sleigh/src/slghsymbol.rs (SleighBaseTrans)`).

The corresponding decoding path retains `OpcodeDecoder` through symbol tables,
subtables and constructor templates. XML opcode names and packed opcode values
therefore use the existing format-specific readers, including their validation.
The shared ID table in `decompiler/crates/kuna-sleigh/src/slaformat/ids.rs` defines
every SLA element and attribute once and supplies the complete XML registration
list. Existing `sla` import paths re-export that table. `SleighBase::registry`
builds its XML name lookup on demand; binary decoding uses numeric IDs directly.

Encoding borrows the existing constructor-template slice through the symbol
table, symbols and constructors. It preserves main-section and named-section
order, skips absent sections without renumbering later sections, and reports
invalid handles before reading a template. The mutable `SleighBaseTrans`
callback is used only while decoding new templates. Encoding therefore needs
neither a mutable adapter nor a copy of the template collection.

The compiler's `with` stack owns each block's parsed context changes. Every
enclosed constructor receives copies in outer-to-inner block order, followed
by its local changes. Closing a block removes its assignments from subsequent
constructors. These copies pass directly to the constructor; they do not need
temporary handles in the parser's context-change arena.

Compiler diagnostics for a constructor resolve its stored source-file index
and line number. Consistency checks and section finalization share this lookup,
so included-file diagnostics keep the constructor's location after parsing
returns to the parent file. No separate constructor-location map is maintained.

The consistency checker rejects a temporary that is read exactly once and
written exactly once in the same semantic section when the read precedes or
occurs in the write operation. This fatal error propagates through constructor
optimization and the compiler pipeline before encoding can produce an image.
The CLI prints the error's explanation and exits with status 2. A correctly
ordered write and read remains eligible for copy propagation.

Consistency checks borrow template varnodes and their size and offset fields.
Selecting a copy-propagation rule and reporting unused temporaries iterate the
existing records in increasing offset order, without copying their keys into
a separate collection. Only a selected rule is copied out of the read-only
search; applying it retains the owned varnode copy needed to rewrite an operation.
Overlapping temporary records are borrowed while computing their combined span
and read/write counts, then the map entries are replaced by the merged record.
Both traversals visit existing definitions in order and the new record last;
coalescing does not build an owned copy of the records.

After consistency checking, the compiler checks whether different operands of a
constructor can export the same temporary storage. It follows subtable exports
and re-exports, including the temporary used by a dynamic export, while ignoring
constant and register exports. Each operand traversal visits a symbol once.
Constructors without a main template, with fewer than two operands, or containing
only build directives are skipped. The compiler reports at most one collision
per constructor and a total count; `slacomp -c` adds the conflicting operand names
and constructor location. These warnings do not change the compiled image.

Both compiler constructor-building entry points use the same complete
finalizer. The entry point accepting a section vector owns it directly; the
parser-arena entry point takes the vector from its slot before delegating.
Finalization borrows this local vector while validating its sections, then
attaches valid templates and context changes. Scope cleanup runs after either
success or a validation error, including constructors without semantic sections.

Parser constructor handles index the runtime's `ConstructorRef` values, which
carry a table identity and an index within that table. Driver helpers pass this
reference through operand creation, section finalization and diagnostics instead
of maintaining a second pair representation. Section checks borrow the existing
operand list. Inherited pattern composition walks the `with` stack directly,
from inner to outer blocks, before combining each outer pattern with the result.
Address-space lookups use the `PcodeCompile` override-or-base policy for both the
parser's expression builders and `CompilerHost` callbacks; the existing public
setters and parser handle types are unchanged.

Pattern construction borrows the equation arena while updating the symbol table.
Later handmap and decision-tree passes traverse the existing table list. When
crossbuilds require extra unique-space offset bits, the compiler updates each
referenced template in place: root table first, then declared subtables, with
each constructor's main section before its named sections. Missing sections are
skipped. The pass does not copy table or template-handle lists, move templates
out of their arena, or alter templates without a constructor reference.
Register-name collision checking likewise walks the global scope directly and
borrows each register's spelling while forming its uppercase comparison key;
collision order and the `-s` policy remain unchanged.
The decoder rebuilds runtime register cross-references from the encoded symbols.
It walks global symbols directly in name order, copying names only for stored
registers, user operations and duplicate-register reports. Duplicate storage
keeps the first register name and reports the later name before that original
name. Context registration and re-registration use the same scope order and
stop at the first error, retaining registrations and cross-references already
completed.

Context values and change masks have matching word counts. Resizing preserves
existing words, zeroes new words and reuses buffer capacity. Partition copies
preserve values and clear explicit-change masks. Context-cache hits refetch the
current database slice; misses update the cached space and bounds before
copying the database's word count into the caller's buffer.

Register-name lookup borrows the selected name until the caller constructs its
return value. The base API returns an owned byte vector; both the native engine
and register snapshots form strings directly from the borrowed bytes. Exact
lookups retain the storage-key comparison;
containing-register lookups retain their address-space identity checks,
same-offset fallback and wrapping bounds. Misses remain empty. Invalid UTF-8
still uses replacement characters in string results.

P-code construction appends default varnodes as a single batch, retaining stable
pool indices and reusing allocations between instructions. Both direct and
dynamic inputs generate their storage location before any auxiliary load; a
pointer adjustment preserves the original queued operation before replacing it
with the addition. Relative labels update one varnode at a time, retaining
wrapping offsets, size masks and partial updates when a later label is missing.
Queued p-code operations pass borrowed varnode slices to the emitter, retaining
stored space-index constants. An unimplemented template is reported from the
failing context's base constructor, with that context's address and the total
instruction length including delay slots.

Memory-state register setters borrow the varnode's address-space handle for the
write. Bank lookup checks the space index once; absent, negative and out-of-range
indices remain unmapped, and constants still read as their own offsets.

XML load images prune redundant chunks in address order, comparing space
identity and wrapping inclusive endpoints. Each surviving original chunk gets
up to 512 zero bytes of padding, bounded by the next chunk and the end of its
space; newly inserted pads are not visited again in the same pass. Encoding
writes lowercase hex directly into the content string, with a leading newline,
a newline after every twentieth byte and a final newline. Decoding retains its
signed-byte stopping rules and permissive digit arithmetic, skipping whitespace
only before each pair. These rules are implemented in
`decompiler/crates/kuna-sleigh/src/loadimage_xml.rs`.

XML image relocation uses the same ordered operation for byte chunks and
symbols. The signed adjustment is scaled by each address space's word size,
truncated to a signed 32-bit byte offset, then added with address wrapping.
Colliding keys keep the last value visited in the original address order.
Chunks are relocated before symbols; read-only markers and the symbol cursor
keep their existing addresses.

Named register bit ranges with byte-aligned ends use ordinary varnodes at the
appropriate byte offset for the declared endianness. Other ranges register a
compiler-only bitrange symbol holding the parent register, least-significant
bit offset and width. Existing bitrange expression and assignment builders
lower reads and writes; symbol-table cleanup removes these aliases before
encoding. Zero-width and out-of-bounds ranges retain their existing errors.

The three attachment directives share duplicate reporting and the replacement
loop for pattern-value lookup, table-size validation and symbol construction.
Duplicate entries are removed in their original order, preserving the selected
warning symbol. Variable attachments check register widths after the duplicate
warning and before replacing symbols. Each directive keeps its existing table
representation, diagnostic labels and public entry point.

Symbol cleanup takes ownership of removed arena slots and uses their existing
names and operand lists. Macros and unused subtables lose their operand locals;
non-operand locals and empty non-global scopes are also discarded. Retained
symbols stay in place until compaction. The compacted ids update scope name
bindings as well as parent scopes and symbol references, so name lookup and
scope iteration remain consistent with numeric lookup after repeated cleanup.

Symbol insertion gives the scope map one owned name and borrows the stored
symbol's name when reporting a duplicate. A rejected duplicate still occupies
its assigned slot while the original scope binding stays intact. Replacing a
symbol updates that binding directly, including when the replaced slot came
from a rejected insertion; its id and scope are preserved.

Expression copies in operands and context changes remap embedded operand
references after symbol compaction or constructor operand reordering. Both
remappers use one left-to-right walk. Table-id callbacks run once per reference;
completed updates remain if a later callback panics. Index remapping leaves
negative and out-of-range indices unchanged.

Pattern construction borrows completed constructor patterns while folding their
common subpattern and populating decision nodes. Context validation borrows the
constructor's changes. Each decision node still owns its simplified patterns,
moving the simplifier's result directly into the node. Source patterns and
context changes remain owned by their constructors.

Snippet expressions have no built-in `new` operation. The byte lexer treats
`new` as an ordinary identifier, resolved through local and language symbols.
Clearing a snippet removes its result, diagnostics and
non-space locals, including `inst_dest` and `inst_ref`, while preserving space
symbols and the temporary base.

Runtime context application borrows the constructor's commands and expressions.
Commands run in stored order against the mutable parser context; evaluation
stops at the first error without undoing preceding local updates or queued commits.

Runtime handle resolution borrows operand expressions and result templates from
its immutable SLEIGH tables. It writes computed handles to the parser context;
if evaluation fails, earlier handle updates remain in place.

Operand-value evaluation borrows explicit defining expressions and owns the
expressions returned by defining symbols. Its synthetic walker stores only an
instruction offset: the referenced operand's offset when its constructor is
on the current path, otherwise the current node's offset. Instruction reads
use that offset; context reads retain the local parser context, and address
values use the cross context when supplied. Missing definitions evaluate to
zero; nested operand references from the synthetic walker are rejected.

Constructor operand patterns use the defining symbol when present. Otherwise,
pattern generation borrows the operand's defining expression without copying
its tree. The operand retains ownership of the expression throughout the build.

Token-pattern concatenation shares the existing minimum-length calculation
and performs one final intersection with a nonnegative alignment shift.
Interior-ellipsis cases use zero shift; invalid interior or double ellipses
retain their existing rejection order. True patterns use the same constructor
as boolean patterns, with no tokens or ellipses.

Aligned instruction patterns intersect and find their common subpattern from
borrowed blocks. Blocks are normalized when constructed or decoded, so a zero
alignment shift needs no copied block or additional normalization.

Block normalization removes leading zero mask words, shifts mask and value
words together past leading zero bytes, and truncates words after the final
nonzero mask. Fixed-width bit counts determine the leading and trailing byte
padding. Always-true and always-false blocks retain empty storage and zero
offset; ordinary blocks retain the same significant byte span.

Mask and value reads share one word extractor, preserving unsigned word-index
conversion, zero fill outside the stored words and masked shift counts.
Specialization, identity and intersection resolution compare instruction then
context constraints with the same short-circuit order and absent-block rules.

OR-pattern simplification uses the same conservative truth query as callers:
one alternative must itself be always true. The query for unconstrained
instruction bits still requires every alternative to qualify. Block comparisons
bound each positive remaining span to one word and retain the existing maximum
extent.

Expression evaluation uses one arithmetic traversal for runtime walker values
and compiler leaf substitutions. Each mode supplies its leaf reader; both visit
left before right, stop at the first leaf error, and retain wrapping arithmetic,
masked shift counts and the existing division behavior. A failed substitution
retains the cursor progress made before the error or panic.

Token alignment compares matching prefix or suffix slices in the required
direction, retaining the first mismatch and ellipsis error order. Reverse
alignment sums unmatched token sizes from right to left. Common subpatterns
copy the shared prefix or suffix once, retaining token metadata and the same
ellipsis flags; combining patterns leaves both inputs unchanged.

Decision nodes enumerate compatible branch values in ascending order without
building a temporary list. Terminal nodes sort pattern indices by specialization
while retaining the original patterns for conflict checks. The sorted prefix
determines each insertion point; conflict resolution still identifies entries
by matching pattern values and constructor ids. Once checking finishes,
patterns move into their final order. Sorting does not copy pattern trees or
search copies to recover their indices.

Field selection reuses a bounded counter array for candidates up to eight bits
wide. Each score resets only the candidate's bins; fixed-pattern counts, entropy
arithmetic, candidate order and tie-breaking remain unchanged. Each pass
explicitly examines context fields before instruction fields. Root and child
nodes both start from the same default state.

Runtime constructor resolution and matched-pattern capture share one decision
walk. The matched leaf supplies both the constructor id and the precise pattern
needed for instruction masking. Id-only callers borrow the leaf without cloning
its pattern. Non-subtable symbols use the same index validation in both APIs.

Syntax construction examines the last display piece once. Standalone whitespace
chunks normalize to one space, adjacent literals coalesce, and operand pieces
keep their boundaries. Empty chunks are ignored; the first-whitespace index is
recorded before deciding whether a chunk merges with the previous piece.

Constructor printing shares literal and operand-piece handling across full
text, mnemonic and body output. Each entry point retains its piece boundaries
and flow-through operand dispatch. Literals retain lossy UTF-8 conversion;
operand references retain the existing validation. Constructor-level failures
keep partial text and walker progress. The public assembly string wrapper
still clears both output strings when an error is returned.

Pattern-building failures report the accumulated reasons. Subtable errors
identify the table at its source location, and unreferenced-table warnings
include its name. Decision-tree errors retain both constructors' table-qualified
references, so equal local constructor ids in different tables remain separate
errors. Reports identify both source locations, including included files.
Identical patterns are always errors; unresolved overlaps are reported when
strict conflict checking is requested with `-l`.

Finalized macro templates are shared immutably between their symbols and the
compiler's expansion table. Expanding a macro borrows this shared definition
and creates independent output operations for parameter substitution and label
adjustment. It does not copy the entire definition first. The expansion table
contains only completed definitions; an invalid macro index still rejects the
expansion.

(kuna) **Mixed builds.** The engine binary `kuna` runs can come from a different
build than `kuna` itself (an override naming another install, or a sibling left
behind when only `kuna` was rebuilt), and nothing in the output shows it. So every
spawn of `decomp_dbg` or `decomp_test_dbg` exports the parent's identity as
`KUNA_PARENT_BUILD`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/kuna_buildstamp.rs (identity, answer_parent, report)`).
The child compares it with its own before reading its arguments and, only when the
two differ, writes one `kuna-build-mismatch: <identity>` line to stderr. `kuna`
removes that line from the captured stderr before anything reads it (`kuna test`
parses the unit-test grammar from the same stream) and prints one warning per
process naming both paths, both identities, and the flag or variable that chose the
child. Stdout is not involved, so no transcript, datatest result or `--json`
document can be disturbed, and a child older than the handshake simply ignores the
variable. The variable name and the reply prefix are read by builds that differ by
definition, so they stay fixed.

An identity is the version `kuna --version` prints plus a hash of the selected
child's production source graph, the workspace `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/build.rs`). `decomp_dbg` is rooted at
`kuna-console`; `decomp_test_dbg` is rooted at `kuna-harness`, so runner-only
changes cannot masquerade as a matching test binary. `tests`, `benches` and
`examples` are excluded and CR bytes are skipped. The version alone cannot tell
two source builds apart, since both report the workspace Cargo version. A git
commit would miss uncommitted edits and needs a `.git` that a source tarball
lacks, and a per-build nonce would make a checkout's debug `kuna` disagree with
its release child. A content hash has none of these problems. Every included
input is a Cargo rerun trigger and an unreadable input fails the build rather than
silently weakening the identity. `kuna-cli`'s own sources are outside both hashes:
they are not part of either child.

(kuna) **Loading a spec.** A `.sla` is a zlib stream behind a `sla\x04` header,
inflated and checksum-verified in full before a single element is decoded
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-sleigh/src/slaformat.rs (FormatDecode::ingest_stream)`).
The decompressed buffer is then *handed* to the packed decoder rather than
copied into it (`decompiler/crates/kuna-base/src/marshal.rs
(PackedDecode::ingest_owned)`): the inflate buffer becomes the decoder's leading
byte chunk as it stands, and only the trailing partial chunk is copied, to carry
the `ELEMENT_END` pad that ends the input one byte past its last. Where the
chunk boundaries fall is not observable — a Position carries its chunk index and
that chunk's own end offset, so a boundary decides only how often the cursor
crosses one — and nothing else about ingestion moves: the first NUL byte still
ends the input (no valid packed byte is zero), and reading past the pad is still
`Unexpected end of stream`. Decoding rests on the same distinction: an encoded
integer lying wholly inside the current chunk is read from that chunk's slice in
one step, while a read that reaches the chunk's end stays on the byte cursor,
which is where end-of-stream is detected (`marshal.rs
(PackedDecode::read_integer)`).

(kuna) **The option-name contract.** Every `kuna` surface that takes
`--option NAME VALUE` checks the NAME in its own parser, before a binary is
opened or a `decomp_dbg` spawned
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/optname.rs (check)`), against the two tables the
engine dispatches on: the kuna stage-model options
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/options.rs (KUNA_OPTION_NAMES)`)
and the upstream `OptionDatabase` element ids
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/options.rs
(UPSTREAM_OPTION_ELEMENTS)`). An unrecognized name exits 2 and names the nearest
catalogued spelling; nothing is decompiled. The check is up front rather than at
dispatch because the settable namespace is the control surface an agent reasons
with: a name that is silently ignored turns "flipping this decision changed
nothing" into evidence that the decision is innocent, when in fact it never
flipped. The subprocess surface could not learn it any other way — the console
reports an unknown name as an `Execution error:` on **stdout** while keeping the
session alive and exiting 0, and the driver deliberately does not treat a console
diagnostic as a verdict (§0.2), so the rejection had nowhere to surface.

(kuna) **The option-value contract.** The VALUE is the engine's to judge — each
option owns its grammar (`on`/`off`, a closed word set, a count, a prototype
model name) and only `Architecture::set_kuna_option` and `OptionDatabase::set`
know it — so, unlike the NAME, it cannot be checked in the parser. The in-process
surfaces get the refusal as a `Result` and stop
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all.rs (apply_one_option)`), while the
subprocess surface has only the transcript: the console reports the refusal as an
`Execution error:` and, because the driver's script arrives on **stdin** rather
than as a pushed script — `errorisdone` is set only by
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/interface.rs (push_script_state)` — the
session simply runs on. The run then printed the DEFAULT C and exited 0, which is
the same false evidence the name check exists to prevent, and worse for being
indistinguishable from a decision point that genuinely changes nothing. So
`decompile.rs (option_failure)` attributes a diagnostic to the `option` echo
above it exactly as the analysis-commit arm does, and answers with
`option <name>: <reason>` and exit 1 — the wording and the status
`apply_one_option` already uses. This is a narrow exception to §0.2's rule that a
console diagnostic is not a verdict, and it stays narrow by attribution: only a
diagnostic whose own command was an `option` line is one, and the arm sits behind
the architecture arm, since a failed `load file` makes every later `option`
answer `No load image present` — a consequence, not a bad value. A value the
engine accepts, including one upstream's own lenient parsers tolerate, is
untouched; so is a two-parameter form such as `--option togglerule "subright
off"`, which reaches the console as the three tokens it wants.

(kuna) **Surfacing a failed function.** A per-function pipeline abort is
*recoverable*: the drive catches the unwind and returns the reason as an error
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs (panic_message)`
recovers the panic payload's text — it must take the `catch_unwind` payload by
value, since a `&Box<dyn Any + Send>` downcasts as the box and loses the
message). Each front-end then decides how to report it, and every one of them
must make the failure observable:

- `decompile-all` / `decompile-project` / wasm record it as the function's
  `error` field and continue the batch (above).
- The console keeps the session alive — it prints `Skipping <fn>: <reason>` and
  returns success, so a datatest's `<stringmatch>` rules still evaluate rather
  than the whole file erroring
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/ifacedecomp.rs`, the `IfcDecompile`
  error arm). Because the *previous*, un-decompiled `Funcdata` survives, a
  following `print C` renders a shell with no structured blocks; the arm
  therefore stamps the reason onto that `Funcdata`
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata.rs
  (Funcdata::set_kuna_pipeline_failure)`) so the emitted comment names the
  abort instead of blaming structuring (chapter
  [09](09-emission.md) §9.2).
- `kuna decompile` recognizes that notice in the subprocess transcript
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile.rs (find_pipeline_failure)`) and
  reports it: the reason plus the forwarded `decomp_dbg` stderr on its own
  stderr, and **exit 1** — the shell still goes to stdout. Without this the
  command exits 0 with a plausible-looking empty function, because the rendered
  shell is not empty (DIV-45; the contract is `docs/cli.md`).

(kuna) **The stdout boundary.** Every CLI command renders its output and hands it
to `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/output.rs (emit)` rather than calling
`println!`, which panics — exit 101, with a Rust panic trace on stderr — as soon
as a downstream reader closes the pipe, because Rust `SIG_IGN`s SIGPIPE and the
print macros unwrap the resulting `EPIPE`. A closed pipe is a normal terminal
condition, so the boundary is fallible and the failure is folded into the status
the command already reached (`output.rs (status_after)`): `BrokenPipe` keeps that
status and says nothing, any other write error is reported and forces 1.

Keeping the status is the load-bearing half. The write failed because nobody was
reading, which is orthogonal to whether the work succeeded, and stderr is still
open — so collapsing it to 0 would convert a false red into a false green:
`kuna test | head` would report a REGRESSED parity run as passing, and the DIV-45
contract above would hold only while someone was listening. `kuna specs` is the
one command whose stdout is a child's (`slacomp`): it streams that pipe through
the same boundary and leaves stderr inherited, because slacomp's diagnostics are
on stderr while the `Compiling <spec>:` line that attributes them is on stdout,
and capturing both would print every warning of a run ahead of every progress
line (DIV-89).

Script construction borrows the parsed single-function request. The subprocess
driver supplies its resolved binary path, effective address mode, output paths
and per-attempt defaults separately; retries and transcript diagnostics remain
in that driver. The script module owns command ordering and path quoting. Raw
and object-image loads retain their distinct spellings, explicit options follow
injected defaults, and each assertion keeps its existing application slot.

(kuna) **The console's filename grammar.** `kuna decompile` is the one front-end
that reaches the engine through a console *script* rather than an in-process
call: it writes `load file <path>` / `openfile write <path>` into `decomp_dbg`'s
stdin (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile/script.rs (build_script_for_input)`), where the
other three read the image with `bootstrap_from_object` and never tokenize the
path at all. Upstream reads every path with `s >> filename`, a pure whitespace
scan, so a path containing a space arrived as two arguments: `load file` took the
head as a BFD target and loaded the tail, and `openfile write` truncated the
redirect at the split, writing the C to a file named after the first component.
The four commands that take a path — `load file`, `openfile write`, `openfile
append`, `parse file` — now read it with
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/interface.rs (CommandStream::read_filename)`,
which accepts an optional double-quoted argument (`\"` and `\\` are escapes
inside quotes; any other backslash is literal, so a Windows path survives either
spelling) and is byte-identical to `read_token` for unquoted input, so the
vendored corpus and every script written before quoting existed parse exactly as
before. The two producers — `decompile/script.rs (console_path)` and its mirror in
`scripts/decompile.py` — quote only a path that needs it, which keeps the emitted
script byte-identical for every path that works today, including for an older
`decomp_dbg` reached through `--decomp-dbg` (DIV-100).

The redirect's own write is fallible for the same reason. `decomp_dbg` re-syncs
the open redirect after every command
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/bin/decomp_dbg.rs (sync_redirect_file)`),
and the open both creates and TRUNCATES its target, so discarding the error is
how a mis-parsed path became silent data loss. A target that cannot be opened or
written is now reported on stderr, once per target — the CLI forwards that into
its failure report, so a write that did not happen is never mistaken for a
decompiler that produced nothing.

(kuna) **One decompile step, two surfaces.** Every front-end turns a function
into a `Funcdata` through the same driver-tier step
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/decompile_step.rs (decompile_one)`), which
wraps the engine drive
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs
(decompile_func_full_with_override_dyn)`) in the parts of the per-function
contract that are policy rather than pipeline. Today that is format-string
varargs typing (chapter [01](01-program-prep.md) §1.4), in two parts. The
shipped default (`formatstring static`) is a park-and-consume: the step hands
the FIRST drive the per-call-site prototype overrides the load-time resolver
already parked for this function on the architecture, which costs nothing beyond
installing them — but it means a function that has one may not adopt IR followed
before the park, because a prototype override is consumed at flow time. The
step then checks each parked override against that first drive, and withdraws
any the drive contradicts: a call that passes a different number of arguments
than the override declares, or a format argument that is not the resolved
string. The function is then driven once more without those overrides. Under
`formatstring full` the step also runs the loop the option began as: decompile
once, read the constant format strings off the lifted printf/scanf-family
`CALL`s, install the derived overrides and decompile a second time. Reading a
constant that way needs read-only propagation, so the step enables it for the
duration of the loop and restores the prior value. The caller supplies only the facts it has — the console its `map addr` /
`parse line` / `override` state, the whole-binary loop the function's DWARF
locals and the no-return flow prunes — through one seed struct, and both the
console `decompile` command
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/ifacedecomp.rs`, `IfcDecompile`) and the
whole-binary loop
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project.rs (decompile_targets)`, behind
`decompile-all` / `decompile-project` / wasm) go through it. Duplicating the
step is a defect, not a variation: while the loop lived only in the console
command, `--option formatstring on` was a **silent no-op** on every whole-binary
surface even though `--mode aggressive` — and therefore `auto` under 500 KiB —
named it, so every benchmark number was measured on the weaker of the two. Making
both surfaces honour it then exposed what it costs: a caller whose call sites
yield an override is decompiled **twice**, which is +43% to +77% on a
printf-heavy whole binary (DIV-66). That cost is the reason the typing now
happens at load instead, and the reason `full` — the loop — remains a per-run
opt-in rather than the default.

(kuna) **Surface defaults.** The drivers inject their defaults before the option
pass, from one shared table
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all.rs (driver_default_options)`), and
which bundle a surface takes is named at its one call site rather than inferred: `option listing on` (DIV-15 — without the Listing the
default-on no-return propagation is a structural no-op, and a stripped binary's
unnamed exit wrapper swallows every following function into its caller), and
`option funcstart_patterns on` plus `option aif on` for non-x86-64 objects only
(DIV-20 — the prologue-pattern pass and the aggressive gap-walk are the primary
discovery sources where the x86-64 scan oracle does not apply).

The discovery bundle belongs to every surface, `kuna functions` included
(DIV-68). Discovery passes exist to add entries, so an inventory command that
declined them reported an entry set the whole-binary command contradicted —
`decompile-all` decompiled functions `functions` did not list. Because both
non-x86-64 passes read the Listing's code units and are inert without it, the
Listing is part of that bundle and not separable from it. The Listing-only
default remains the decompiling surfaces': on x86-64 it is measured entry-neutral,
so building it for enumeration would buy nothing and cost a whole-program decode.
Every injection yields to an explicit caller option — the driver skips it whenever
the caller (or the resolved preset) names that option at all — and none of them
touches the engine default or the console/datatest surfaces.

Single-function `kuna decompile` reads the same table, and that is why the table
is shared rather than duplicated: it builds a `decomp_dbg` script instead of
loading in-process, so it applies the pairs as `option` lines ahead of
`read symbols` (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile/script.rs (build_script_for_input)`).
What it does differently is *when*. It injects the Listing up front and holds the
discovery half back for a **second attempt**, made only when the console answers
a by-name selection with `no function matches`.

The gap that forced this: on a non-x86-64 image `kuna functions` listed, and
`kuna decompile-all` decompiled, entries that exist only because
`funcstart_patterns` found them, while `kuna decompile <that generated name>`
answered that no such function exists. kuna printed a name it would not then
accept, which is worse than not finding the function at all — an agent cannot
tell a name it mistyped from a name the tool minted. It hid behind the mode
policy, since `auto` resolves to `aggressive` under 500 KiB and that preset names
all three options itself, so it surfaced only above the size threshold or under
an explicit `--mode reliable`.

The retry rather than plain alignment, because the bundle is not free. It changes
the ENTRY SET, and not every entry it adds is real: on i386 and PPC64 the
prologue matcher seeds a start a few bytes inside a function it already knew
(PPC64 ELFv2's local entry point sits 8 bytes past the global one), and
`funcboundflow` truncates the outer function's flow at that seed, so a
`__do_global_ctors_aux` that decompiles to a loop becomes an empty husk. A
whole-binary surface takes that trade knowingly — its inventory has to contain
everything it will decompile, and the husk is a discovery defect to fix at the
analyzer tier, not a reason to under-enumerate. A caller who has already named
one function gains nothing from the wider inventory unless the name is not there,
which is exactly the condition the retry tests. So the first attempt is the
script this surface has always emitted, and only a MISS — not an ambiguity, not a
load failure, not a pipeline abort, and never an `--addr` selector — buys the
second one.

(kuna) **The watchdog.** `decompile-all --max-fn-seconds N` (`0` disables) is
driver policy, not a phase-model option. An unfiltered whole-binary run in the
resolved `fast` preset defaults to 10 seconds per function. Native selected
runs and other presets retain 120 seconds, and an explicit value always wins.
The WASM front-end arms the same 10-second budget only for fast whole-binary
`decompile` and `project` commands; its other commands remain unbudgeted. The
driver sets the budget on the
architecture (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all.rs
(decompile_all)`), which the drive arms as a wall-clock deadline covering
flow-follow, the jump-table sub-pipeline, and the action pipeline
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs
(decompile_func_full_with_override_dyn)`). The deadline is probed cooperatively —
at every group/sub-action boundary and repeat gate
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/action.rs (ActionGroup::apply,
Action::perform, ActionRestartGroup::apply)`), every 1024 op-visits inside the
rule-pool loop (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/action.rs
(POOL_DEADLINE_STRIDE)`), and at the heritage loop
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p3_dataflow/heritage.rs`). On expiry the
containers stop scheduling work and unwind; the driver converts that into the
function's `error` record and the batch continues. A function whose drive
completes before expiry is byte-identical with or without a budget, and the
console/parity paths never set one. It is not a hard wall around discovery,
unprobed SLEIGH work, C rendering and variable extraction, assembly/JSON
construction, total project time, or memory.

(kuna) **Synthesized structures across a batch.** With `structsynth` on, a
function decompiled later can measure more of a record that an earlier one has
already named. The layout ledger then mints the larger layout beside the older
one instead of widening it (chapter [05](05-types.md) §5.2, struct synthesis).
After an eager batch (`decompile_targets` behind `decompile-all`,
`decompile_export_targets` behind a non-stream `decompile-project`),
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project.rs (converge_synthesized_structs)`
asks the ledger which names have been superseded and decompiles again, once,
exactly the results that spell one. The default callee-first order
(`protoorder`, chapter [04](04-calls-and-prototypes.md)) runs the same sweep at
its end, in its own plan order
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all/callee_first.rs (converge_callee_first)`).

(kuna) Which `struct_N` a layout becomes is decided by the order the program is
visited in, so the whole-program surfaces that keep a ledger take the SAME
order. `decompile-project` asks
`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all.rs (callee_first_decision)` the
question `decompile-all` asks and runs the same loop with the export's own
per-function options
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project.rs (export_options)`), so a name in
the exported header is the record `decompile-all` means by it. Without that the
two disagreed wherever the orders diverged -- on coreutils `du` -O2, 29 of 30
synthesized names -- and nothing on either surface said so. A streamed export
writes each body as it finishes and cannot buffer a plan, so it keeps the
address-order schedule and says on stderr that the option does not reach it; the
browser front-end's `project` export calls the eager batch directly
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-wasm/src/lib.rs`) and keeps that schedule too, since the
plan is a `kuna-cli` driver. If a redo fails where the first pass
succeeded, for example because it ran past a watchdog budget that the first pass
fit in, the first body is kept. That body still names a structure that is
defined. The streamed export has already written its bodies before any name can
be superseded, so it runs no sweep. On both paths the header declares only what
the document names. `build_header` passes the type block through
`prune_unreferenced_synth_types`, which keeps a synthesized `struct_<digits>`
definition only when a prototype, a body, an exported variable row or a field of
another kept definition names it. The test reads names and never needs a body,
so it also holds for streamed records, whose `code` is already `None` by the
time the header is built.

(kuna) **The worker pool.** The per-function loop is ~96% of a whole-binary run's
wall clock, and the engine is structurally single-threaded: a `Funcdata` holds
`Rc<ArchContext>` and the flow environment a raw `*const Architecture`, so nothing
in the pipeline is `Send`. `--jobs N` on `decompile-all`, `decompile-project` and
`decompile-graph` therefore fans the loop out over **processes**, re-executing the
`kuna` binary itself (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs.rs`) in a hidden worker
mode. `--jobs 1` is the default and is the in-process loop above, unchanged; the
console and parity paths never see a pool.

The record codec is isolated in `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs/wire.rs`;
it does not own worker processes or scheduling. Chunk specifications and result
frames retain their existing version markers, little-endian fields and field
order. A worker flushes each completed function's result, and the parent keeps
every complete frame before a truncated tail. Wire counts reserve no more
storage than the remaining bytes can justify. Literal-byte tests pin both
formats independently of their decoders.

Worker-result reconciliation indexes produced records by byte address and
then walks the requested targets in order. The last produced record for an
address wins, and each stored record is consumed once; missing records become
errors without moving neighboring results. Lookup-table iteration cannot
determine output order.

Scratch storage is owned by `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs/scratch.rs`.
The session holds a temporary-directory guard through inventory, worker and
result handling, so normal return, errors and unwinding all release its files.
Directory creation is exclusive and requests private Unix permissions before
any content is written; the final mode remains 0700 regardless of umask. Missing
temporary parents are still created. Names retain the owner-pid prefix used by
workers and the existing orphan sweep; parent-liveness and stale-owner policies
are unchanged.

Synthesized-structure reconciliation is owned by
`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs/synth.rs`. It keeps the first-pass and sweep
caches, replay plans, compatible renames and serial fallback together. The pool
hands it the recorded run and receives the final worker kind and optional table;
worker lifetime, chunk scheduling and record serialization remain separate.

The pool is driver policy, and its contract is that it cannot be observed in the
output. Work is planned longest-first into equal-work chunks and handed out
dynamically, which is deliberately not output order; every target owns a slot
index and results are filed positionally, so the merged document is identical to
`--jobs 1` whatever order the workers finish in. On `decompile-all` that is
`--jobs 1 --option protoorder off`: the serial default decompiles callees first
(chapter [04](04-calls-and-prototypes.md)) and a worker cannot see another
worker's callees, so a pool never takes that order and says so on stderr before
it starts. `decompile-project` takes the order serially and reports the same
serial run; `decompile-graph` does not, so there the serial run is the plain
one. What the pool cannot make
identical is the emission the engine already makes depend on decompile history:
a handful of type and symbol decisions are first-toucher-wins inside one
process's database, so they follow the SET of functions that process decompiled,
and sharding changes that set. Measured at 2 records in 32,777 on an 18 MB PE,
both a two-byte string constant rendering as `"BM"` rather than the UTF-16
`"䵂"`; narrowing a serial run to one of those functions flips it the same way,
so the dependence is the engine's and not the pool's.

The synthesized structures of `structsynth` are the same kind of state at a
larger scale, and the pool reproduces it instead of living with it. The serial
run names each `struct_N` in decompile order, every ledger lookup reading what
the functions before it minted, and then decompiles once more the functions that
name a structure a later, larger one superseded. A worker left to itself would
number its own structures. What a function ASKS the ledger, though, does not
depend on what it is answered: the evidence is collected before anything is
installed, and a field takes the type an access carried. So the first pool's
workers record every lookup and what their own ledger answered
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p5_types/kuna_structsynth/shard.rs
(SynthRequest)`), and the parent, which decompiles nothing, replays the lookups
in target order through the ledger's own decision
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p5_types/kuna_structsynth/shard.rs
(Replay)`). The replay yields every answer, every mint, the superseded set and
the answers the convergence sweep's lookups will get.

Most functions need nothing more. A function whose own worker answered each
lookup with a structure that has exactly the members of the serial answer's --
it minted what it measured, and so did the serial run under another number --
printed the serial text with other numbers, so the parent renames the
identifiers in its C, prototype, variable types and type definitions
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p5_types/kuna_structsynth/shard.rs
(renaming)`). The renaming is refused when an answer's members differ, when two
names would become one, or when the text spells a structure name the renaming
does not cover or spells one inside a string or character literal
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p5_types/kuna_structsynth/shard.rs
(rename_identifiers)`), and when a name it covers is a symbol's rather than a
type's -- nothing kuna names spells a `struct_N`, but a binary's own symbols
could. On `tar` O2, 100 of the 106 functions that synthesize
are renamed. The rest are decompiled a second time by the same workers, each of
which first destroys the structures it minted itself, and every type built on
one (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p5_types/kuna_structsynth/shard.rs
(forget_minted)`), mints the replayed structures in the serial order
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p5_types/kuna_structsynth/shard.rs
(install_table)`) and answers each lookup with its replayed name; a function the
sweep will decide differently is renamed onto its sweep answers or goes out
twice in that pool, and the parent applies the sweep on the first-pass text
exactly as the serial batch does (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs/synth.rs (name_structs_serially)`). The second
decompile records its lookups as well, and they have to be the first ones,
repeats aside. A decompile can ask one question twice (a restarted pass measures
the same layout again), whether it does follows the process's history, and a
forced worker answers a repeat as it answered the first asking
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p5_types/kuna_structsynth/shard.rs
(distinct)`), so the replay also requires every question to get the same answer
at the end of its function as when it was first asked. A function whose first
answers do change what it asks next is the real exception: its questions up to
the first difference were answered as the serial run answers them, so the parent
takes the corrected record, replays again and renames or decompiles only the
functions whose answers moved.

Replay cache checks borrow the answer names and current definitions instead of
constructing temporary owned keys. A match requires equal answer count, absent
answer positions, names and full definitions; a held name with no minted
definition differs from a newly minted name. Owned keys remain attached to
retained results across replay rounds. Each retained first-pass result also
owns its rename provenance, so replacement and invalidation update the result
and its reported rename count together. The cache stays sparse over functions
that asked the ledger; sweep results remain separate from first-pass results.
Each plan owns its temporary replay. After deriving the answers, superseded
names and ordered worker message, the plan consumes the replay's minted table
into its name lookup instead of copying names and field recipes. Replay rounds
still start from a fresh clone of the same base ledger.

A structure can travel only if another process can rebuild every field type,
and a named type counts only if the worker's load created it
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p5_types/kuna_structsynth/shard.rs
(AtLoad)`): `pebnames` creates `PEB` and `TEB` the first time a function reads
them, so one worker holds them and another does not. When such a field would
have to travel, when the questions do not settle in four rounds, when a repeated
question could be answered differently, or when a second decompile fails where
the first did not (a dead worker, a table it could not install), the functions
that asked are decompiled again in target order by one worker that runs the
ledger and the sweep itself, which is the serial computation restricted to the
only functions that take part in it, and stderr says so. Only a function the
watchdog or a worker failure cut short in the first pool is exempt from the
checks, since it asks a different number of questions on every run.

A `decompile-project` header is rendered by the workers
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs/type_blocks.rs (merge_type_definitions)`). The workers that hold the replayed structures
render their block in full; when no function was decompiled again, every idle
worker installs them before it retires
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs.rs (install_on_idle_workers)`). Every
other worker, including every worker the one-worker path did not use, renders
its block without the structures it minted or installed, so the types its own
functions interned (a `TEB` read by a function that synthesizes nothing) still
reach the header. A block that holds every definition any block holds is the
serial answer and is emitted as is; otherwise the parent warns and emits the
union. The merger parses each block once and borrows complete definition spans
from canonical printer text. Membership and subset checks do not determine
emission order: the first containing block wins, or definitions are appended in
block/item order. CRLF and missing-final-newline input retain the earlier
normalization for comparison and appended items; a selected whole block, and
the first block of a union, remain byte-for-byte as supplied.
Across thirty-two binaries (seventeen projects at O0, O2 and
O2-noinline, stripped and with DWARF, an ARM firmware ELF and two PEs) at
`--jobs 2` and `--jobs 4`, `decompile-all` (text and `--json`),
`decompile-graph` and every `decompile-project` artifact are byte-identical to
the serial run, with 788 of the 852 functions that synthesize renamed at
`--jobs 4`, 93 decompiled again and none sent to the one-worker path; a third
pass that forces every one of them to decompile again lands on the same
documents. (On `decompile-all` the serial side of that comparison is
`--option protoorder off`, above.) What a pool cannot repair is a header type
it never touches: `dash` with DWARF still places one debug-info structure in
one of two spots from one serial run to the next, since the type tree orders it
by an address. `decompile-project --stream` writes each body as
it lands and runs no sweep, so its workers still run with `structsynth off` and
say so
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs.rs (structsynth_shard_note)`). The parent resolves the concrete
`--mode`, every `--option` and the watchdog budget once and passes them to every
worker, so a shard cannot resolve a different policy just because the run was
sharded. `--assert` and `--raw-image` are refused with a pool: assertion outcomes
are per-load state a merge cannot reconstruct, and a raw image's entry seeds are
its load.

A worker's load is the expensive half of it — 17 s and 469 MB on an 18 MB PE, next
to ~70 ms for the average function — so a worker is started once and then serves
chunk after chunk down a pipe until the plan is empty, and is recycled only when
the functions it has decompiled reach a ceiling. That ceiling bounds an allocator
arena rather than a leak: per-function transients are freed, but a process keeps
their high-water mark, so only a fresh worker returns to the memory floor. A
worker also skips the whole-binary discovery the parent has already run
(`fast_funcdisc`), because that discovery is most of the load; its *product* is
what `FlowInfo::queryCall` reads, so the parent hands its canonical inventory
over instead, replayed through the loader-symbol seam
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::seed_function_inventory)`).
The seeding is strictly additive — an address this load already resolves, or a name
it already carries, is left alone — because a name is installed into the scope its
`::` path names, and replacing one buries a name the worker derived correctly.
`--jobs-full-load` restores the parent's exact load in every worker.

Progress is written to stderr. Its ETA is withheld until each worker has completed
its first chunk and then uses only the rate measured after that point, so every
one-time worker load remains in elapsed time without being charged again to each
remaining function.

A pool is also the first arrangement that can enforce the watchdog for real. The
in-process deadline above is cooperative, so a function wedged where nothing probes
it runs straight through; the parent, which is not the stuck process, kills a
worker that has produced no record for well past the budget and records the
function it was running as `error`. The same budget is a wall clock, so a
function that finished just inside it serially can miss it under N-way contention;
the run counts those and says so, as it counts the functions lost to a worker that
died. Cancellation runs the other way: each worker's stdin is a pipe whose only
write end its parent holds, so end of pipe means the parent is gone by any route
including SIGKILL, and the worker removes the pool's scratch directory and exits
rather than running on reparented to init.

A worker that dies — a panic no per-function guard catches, an OOM kill, a
signal, or that stall kill — costs the function it was running and nothing else.
A worker decompiles its chunk in spec order and flushes one record per function,
so the records it leaves are a prefix: the first target without one is the
function it was on, and every later target never started. Before it takes more
work, the thread that served the chunk re-runs each of those targets once as a
chunk of its own (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs.rs (retry_order)`): the
function that was running goes first, onto the fresh worker the thread starts
next, so the `error` record it ends with is what it does alone, and the targets
that never started follow. Three failures are not re-run, each because a re-run
would repeat a cost no single target caused or one already paid. A function the
stall watchdog killed has already run four times past its budget, and the
in-process watchdog's verdict on such a function is final too. A worker that
never finished a chunk and never opened this one ran none of it and may have died
in its own program load, which every re-run would repeat; the worker opens the
chunk's result file just before its first target, so the file's existence is what
separates the two. And a chunk no worker ran, because its spec could not be
written or no worker could be spawned, failed for a reason no target has. A
re-run is never itself re-run. The cost is one extra worker load for every
function that fails again on its own, since its crash takes the re-run's worker
with it, and the stopping rules only cap that cost where re-running is futile.
Chunks are cut from a size-sorted order and functions that crash alike sit side
by side, so the targets that never started are re-run in bit-reversed order
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs.rs (spread)`): every prefix of that order
samples the whole chunk, and a run of neighbouring crashers cannot look like a
chunk full of them (its weakest pattern is a crasher at every other place, since
the first half of the order is the even offsets). A function that stalls when
re-run costs one stall window and the chunk carries on, as a stall in a planned
chunk costs one function. A chunk stops re-running, and its remaining targets
keep their record with `; not re-run: <why>` appended, at the first re-run that
cannot reach its target (no worker spawns, or the fresh one dies before opening
its chunk), once two of its re-runs have stalled, which caps its extra stall
windows at two, or once eight of those targets have failed again and outnumber
the ones recovered (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs.rs (ChunkReruns)`); the
function that was running only counts toward the stalls, since it is expected to
crash again. And a pool-wide check (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs.rs
(RetryGate)`), asked each time a re-run would start, holds it back while sixteen
or more re-runs have failed and they outnumber every record the workers
delivered, planned or re-run: workers that die on everything deliver nothing and
so pay a bounded number of extra loads, and since a held-back re-run cannot
fail, a run whose workers mostly work catches up and resumes re-running, even
after a burst of crashes among the large functions the planner runs first.
Re-runs stay on the thread whose worker died.
That keeps termination structural — a thread re-runs at most the targets of the
chunk it holds and never waits on another thread — and costs no parallelism,
because that chunk was that thread's serial work to begin with. Every target
still reaches the result sink exactly once, which the positional merge and the
streamed writer below both depend on, and the closing warning reports what the
re-runs recovered separately from what is still lost.

(kuna) **The streamed export.** `decompile-project --stream`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/project_stream.rs`) is the same pool and the
same per-function loop with the opposite contract. It is driver policy too — a
flag rather than a `phases.toml` row, and off by default — and it exists
because the non-stream contract has a cost the pool cannot pay down: a document
that only exists when it is complete makes the whole run dead time for whoever
is waiting on it, which on a 147 MB image is about twenty-one minutes (1,248 s)
at `--jobs 14` before the first line of C. A streamed run writes the folder as it
goes and starts from the entry point, so availability rather than a reproducible
file order is what it optimizes.

That inverts the two things the pool paragraph above rests on. First, the static
plan is replaced by a **dynamic, result-steered scheduler**
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/project_stream.rs (Scheduler)`), handed to the
same worker threads through the chunk-source seam
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jobs.rs (ChunkSource, run_pool_streaming)`)
that `run_pool`'s longest-first plan now also goes through: seeds (the image
entry point and `main`) first, then the frontier their results open up, then the
remaining targets in address order. The steering comes from the results
themselves because the alternative does not fit the budget — building the static
call graph on that image costs ~85 s, which is the wait the flag exists to
remove — so each finished function reports the entries it reaches
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project.rs (FuncResult::callee_hints)`) and
the scheduler intersects them with the resolved target set. Those hints are a
**scheduling hint and not an edge model**: they are never serialized into any
artifact, they are not what `kuna decompile-graph` or `--reachable-from`
traverse — that is `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/callgraph.rs
(CallGraph::callees_of)`, built from the reference index — and intersecting
rather than unioning is what keeps an `--addr`/`--functions` export from growing
callees it was not asked for. The seeds are pool chunks like any other, which is
what keeps one function from ending the export: a stack overflow aborts rather
than unwinding, so a seed decompiled in the parent took the whole run down with
it, where a seed decompiled in a worker costs its own record and nothing else.
That is paid for in the order. Nothing fills the frontier before the pool
starts, so at `--jobs N` the workers that do not draw the seeds spend the first
round on the address cursor and the seeds' neighbourhood lands later in the `.c`
than it did when the parent decompiled them; `--jobs 1`, which keeps the
breadth-first walk exactly, is the setting for a reader who wants the
neighbourhood first, and is also the one setting a dying function can still end.
Second, the contract is **deliberately observable**: the `.c` is in decompile order, and under `--jobs N` its
interleaving is worker completion order and is not reproducible. That is the
feature, not a leak — a reader gets the entry point's neighbourhood in seconds —
and it is paid for by `index.jsonl`, the append-only address-to-offset index
written after each block, which gives back the random access the address
ordering used to provide. The function set, the prototypes and the disassembly
are still what the same selection produces serially. The engine's own
first-toucher dependence rides along with the order, so a streamed run can
differ from a non-stream one in the same handful of bodies the pool already can,
at every job count including `--jobs 1`.

The arrangement is forced by the same `!Send` reality the pool works around, one
level in. Nothing derived from the program crosses a thread: the targets are
flattened to plain specs and the README's program facts snapshotted on the main
thread before the scope opens (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project.rs
(ReadmeFacts::snapshot)`), so what the pool thread sees is data. The **main
thread keeps the program** and runs the disassembly sweep on it, one resumable
step at a time (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project_stream.rs
(AsmSweep)`), which is also why the variable comments a non-stream `.asm` prints
under each label move to their own appended section: the sweep completes long
before the variables exist. A separate **writer thread owns every text
artifact** the results feed — the `.c`, the `.h`, `index.jsonl`, `README.md` and
the `.streaming` status file — and drives them off its own clock rather than off
the result stream, so a run whose functions land in bursts still reports at a
steady rate. At `--jobs 1` there is no pool thread and the main thread
alternates decompile batches with sweep steps instead, so a serial streamed run
starts producing C after its first function and still finishes its `.asm` early.

Owning every artifact also makes the writer the run's failure oracle. A write it
cannot complete means nothing a reader polls is advancing, so it records its own
error, publishes the `failed` status itself and raises a stop flag that the
serial pull closure and the scheduler both read: each producer finishes the
function or chunk it is on and stops, and the run reports the writer's error
rather than the closed channel its producers saw. What a failed run leaves behind
follows the same rule from the other end — until this run has truncated an
artifact of its own, the folder still describes the previous export, so a
failure before that point restores its `README.md` and leaves the status file as
the only trace. Progress writes are the exception in both directions: the status
file and the running README report on the export rather than being it, so a
failed rewrite of either warns and is retried on the next tick.

(kuna) **Declared function boundaries.** Every function boundary the engine knows
is derived: discovery supplies the entries, and the extent is the
address-contiguous clip `[entry, next_entry)` over an unbounded flow follow
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/funcextent.rs`). That is the wrong answer on
exactly the images where reverse engineering is hard — obfuscated, packed or
hand-written code, where a missed entry merges two functions and an invented one
splits a body — so a caller can override both halves.

The primitive is a **declared extent**, entry VMA → byte size, held per program in
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::declared_extents)`
and written by
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::declare_function)`.
Declaring also installs the `FunctionSymbol` and the name→address registration
`map function` installs, so the entry enumerates, resolves by name and names its
call sites; an address that already carries a function symbol is renamed rather
than given a second one, and only when the caller supplied a name. The store is
consulted by every later load of that entry — `load function`, `load addr`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/ifacedecomp.rs`) and the whole-binary loop
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project.rs (decompile_targets)`) — which pass
it as the `Funcdata` size that bounds flow following (chapter
[02 §2.1](02-lift-and-flow.md)), and by `funcextent` when the inventory reports an
extent. A declaration therefore outlives the one command that made it, which is
what separates an interface from a one-shot flag. It also enters the whole-binary
target list whatever the image says about where code lives, because the entry-VMA
set `declare_function` writes
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (ConsoleProgram::declared_entries)`)
is consulted by the section-flag filter above.

(kuna) The same lying flags reach the **run verdict**. A run that discovered
nothing is a failure only when the image carries executable content — a data-only
relocatable object and a resource-only PE have no functions to find, and failing
those would turn a correct answer into an error
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all.rs (classify_code_evidence)`). An
image where *nothing* is flagged executable cleared that test, so the packed case
answered `count: 0`, exit `0`, silent stderr: a successful run's voice for a file
an agent could still get a body out of. An image that declares an **entry point
inside one of its sections** carries code whatever its flags claim, so it is a
failure instead, and the message names the address and the section it landed in
and points at `--define-function`, which is the command that recovers the run.
Landing inside a section is the whole test: a PE with no `AddressOfEntryPoint` is
reported as entering at its bare image base, which no section covers, so the
resource-only case keeps its honest empty answer.

Two surfaces reach it. The console command is `function bounds <start> [<end>]
[as <name>]`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/kuna_console.rs (IfcKunaFunctionBounds)`),
which takes plain integers rather than the `parse_machaddr` address grammar
precisely because that grammar's `[space,offset,size]` size is indistinguishable
from the address width for a small size, and keys the name with `as` so a
declaration that gives a name but no extent cannot have its name read as the end
address. The CLI flag is `--define-function <start[-end][=name] | @file>`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/funcdecl.rs`), repeatable, honored by
`decompile`, `decompile-all`, `functions`, `decompile-project` and `disassemble`.
`end` is exclusive. The script surface emits the console command AFTER `read
symbols` and BEFORE the load, and the in-process surfaces apply the declarations
after `commit_pending_analysis`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all.rs (load_program)`): in both, a
declaration is applied after discovery has had its say, because it is an assertion
that outranks it. Durability is caller-carried — the `@file` form is the artifact,
and kuna does not write boundaries back into the image.

(kuna) **Caller assertions (`--assert`).** Declared boundaries are one fact an
agent can state; the assertion plane is the rest of them. Everything the engine
knows about a program it derived, and the console has long carried the commands
that correct each derivation — `rename`, `retype`, `map param`, `map return`,
`map address`, `comment instruction`, `parse line` — while none of them was
reachable from the `kuna` binary, whose generated script emitted a fixed
vocabulary (`option`, `read symbols`, `load`, `kassert`, `function bounds`,
`decompile`).

A **directive** is one line of an intent-keyed vocabulary — an agent does not have
to know that renaming is P9 to rename something — parsed by
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/assertsyntax.rs` (shared with the in-browser
front-end; `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/assertdecl.rs` keeps the console-script
lowering) and applied by
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/assertions.rs`:

| directive | lowers to | writes at |
|---|---|---|
| `function <start>[-<end>][=<name>]` | `function bounds` | P1, the `--define-function` spelling |
| `typedef <C declaration>` | `parse line` | P5 type-propagation |
| `prototype <func> <C declaration>` | `map prototype` | P4 prototype-source |
| `data <addr> <C typedeclaration>` | `map address` | P5 const-pointer |
| `param [<func>::]<i> <storage> <C typedeclaration>` | `map param` | P4 prototype-source |
| `return [<func>::]<storage> <C typedeclaration>` | `map return` | P4 prototype-source |
| `comment [<func>::]<addr> <text>` | `comment instruction` | P9 external-refinement |
| `flow [<func>::]<addr> branch\|call\|callreturn\|return` | `override flow` | P2 flow-classification |
| `name [<func>::]<symbol> <newname>` | `rename` | P9 naming-policy |
| `type [<func>::]<symbol> <C type>` | `retype` | P5 type-propagation |
| `readonly <addr>+<size>` | `readonly` | P1 code-data-partition |
| `volatile <addr>+<size>` | `volatile` | P1 code-data-partition |
| `bytes <addr> <hex\|@FILE>` | `override bytes` | P1 code-data-partition |

Four application points, and the ordering between them is forced rather than
stylistic. **Image-scoped** directives state what memory holds before anything
reads it. `bytes` replaces the mapped bytes at an address with the caller's own
(`assertions::apply_image_scoped` -> `LoadImage::kuna_overlay_bytes`, implemented
by the object and TE loaders' `overlay_span` methods);
`readonly` and `volatile` OR one boolean
Varnode property over a memory range, and must be stated before the image's
symbols are mapped: `Scope::addMap` folds the range property into each
`SymbolEntry` as it maps it (`database.cc:1156-1158`) and never consults the range
again, so a property painted afterwards is silently inert over every address the
loader named. The generated console script therefore emits them ahead of `read
symbols`; the in-process surface, where `bootstrap_from_object` has already read
the loader's symbols before a caller can say anything, re-applies the property to
the symbols the range covers (`assertions::paint_property`). Both surfaces then
render the same C. `bytes` is bound by the same ordering for a different reason:
the bytes it states are the INPUT to every later decode, and nothing re-reads an
address it has already lifted, so it is applied ahead of the analysis commit on
both surfaces (`load_program` before `commit_pending_analysis`; the script's
image slot before `read symbols`). It is the one fact a loader cannot derive at
all — a packer's plaintext exists only once the packer has run — and the recorded
workaround was patching a copy of the executable with an external script
(`docs/re-needs/byte-overlay-assertion-recovered.md`). The overlay lives in the
load image and nothing is written to disk. Two limits follow from where it lands
and are reported rather than papered over: an address no loaded segment maps is
REJECTED naming the span, since inventing backing store would decompile a program
the caller never described; and the loader's analysis passes have already run over
the file image, so function discovery does not see a recovered layer — its
functions are declared with `function`/`--define-function` in the same assertion
file. **Program-scoped** directives (`function`, `typedef`, `prototype`,
`data`) are applied right after the analysis commit
(`ConsoleProgram::set_assertions` + `assertions::apply_program_scoped`, called
from `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile_all.rs (load_program)`), for the
same reason a declared boundary is: an assertion outranks discovery.
**Function-scoped** directives (`param`, `return`, `comment`, `flow`) become
decompile SEEDS (`assertions::function_seed`), because a prototype fact is
consumed at flow time and cannot be applied afterwards. **Symbol-scoped** directives (`name`,
`type`) can only be applied to an already-decompiled function — the local they
name does not exist until a decompile has produced it — so
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project.rs (decompile_targets)` decompiles,
applies them to the first pass's `Funcdata` (`assertions::apply_symbol_scoped`),
and decompiles again with the mutated local scope carried across as
`mapped_symbols`. That second pass is emitted only when such a directive bound to
the function, so every run without one costs exactly what it did before. The
script surface (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile/script.rs (build_script_for_input)`)
emits the same facts at the same three slots, with the same conditional second
`decompile`.

(kuna) **A symbol-scoped directive reaches the register locals too, by mapping a
Symbol over their storage.** `name`/`type` resolve their target through
`ScopeLocal::query_by_name`, which sees only the locals a `Symbol` backs: the
stack slots and the parameters. Every register-resident local kuna prints
(`v6 // rax`) is a HighVariable the naming pass named directly, with nothing in
the scope behind it, so the plane could not name the majority of a function's
variables — while `kuna decompile --help` taught `type v2 char[16]` on exactly
such a name. When the scope answers nothing,
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/kuna_hightarget.rs` looks the printed
identifier up among the HighVariables, takes the name representative's storage
and `Varnode::getUsePoint`, and maps an isolated, locked Symbol there — the
mapping `type varnode %RAX(pc) <type>` already made, keyed by the identifier the
printer chose instead of by a hand-written varnode specifier. `linkSymbol`'s
`query_container_for_link(addr, usepoint)` then binds it on the second pass, and
`assertions::carried_usepoint_symbols` carries it across the in-process surface's
IR rebuild.

Three properties of that mapping are load-bearing, each measured on
`sub_1005350` of the `graphy` VM:

* **The usepoint is not decoration.** Mapped with an invalid usepoint — the
  whole-scope mapping an ordinary stack local gets — the entry matches every read
  of the register in the function, more than one high binds it, and the printer
  declares the storage twice (`unsigned long *v6; // rax` beside a bare
  `unsigned long v6;`) in a body that uses both. That is invalid C, so the target
  carries the representative's own use point.
* **The Symbol is left for the naming pass to number.** Binding the printed
  identifier back as a namelocked Symbol keeps the caller's name on the variable,
  and is also invalid C: the `vN` allocator does not consult the scope, so it
  hands the same `v5` to an unrelated temporary and the body declares `v5` twice.
  A bare `type v6 <T>` therefore states no name, and the retyped local can come
  back under a different number; its storage comment is what identifies it across
  the two passes, and `type v6 <T> <newname>` pins a name outright.
* **Only addressable storage is a target.** A `unique`-space temporary is
  renumbered on every IR rebuild and a `join` is a synthetic register pair, so a
  Symbol mapped over one binds nothing on the second pass and survives as a
  declared-but-unused local while the variable the caller aimed at is unchanged.
  Reporting that as `applied` is the failure this plane exists to end, so such a
  target is rejected with `Not addressable storage`. Naming a decompiler
  temporary durably needs the dynamic-hash channel
  (`Funcdata::seed_dynamic_recommendations`), which this does not use.

(kuna) **A `prototype` directive binds to `<func>`, whatever name its declaration
carries.** The operand says which function the signature describes; the
declaration supplies the return type, the parameter types and the parameter
names. That is what makes the directive usable on the function an agent has just
worked out — `prototype sub_1400055e0 void *sha256(void *out,void *input)` — where
the whole point is that the declaration is written under a name the image does
not use. The in-process surface has always overwritten the parsed
`PrototypePieces::name` with `<func>` (`assertions::apply_prototype`); the script
surface lowered the directive to `parse line extern <decl>`, which is keyed by the
DECLARED name (`Architecture::setPrototype`'s `queryFunction(basename)`), so a
renaming declaration parked a signature on a fresh symbol nothing referenced and
left the selected function with its recovered one — silently, and `exit 0` even
under `--assert-strict`, because the console reported no error for a prototype it
had genuinely parsed. The console spelling of the directive is therefore
`map prototype <func> <C declaration>`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/kuna_console.rs (IfcKunaMapPrototype)` ->
`ifacedecomp.rs (bind_prototype)`), which takes the target as its first token and
parks the pieces under it; `parse line extern` keeps its upstream meaning.

(kuna) **`<func>` is a name first and an ENTRY ADDRESS second.** Both surfaces
resolve the operand through
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/assertions.rs (resolve_proto_target)`. An
existing name first goes through the same public `ConsoleProgram::resolve_entry`
contract as decompilation: aliases canonicalize to their entry, a PE import
slot/thunk pair narrows to its lone executable thunk, and two executable
definitions are rejected as ambiguous rather than chosen by symbol-table order.
The result parks by that entry address. An unresolved name stays pending by name,
which preserves the console workflow where `map prototype main …` precedes the
symbols it describes; failing that, a hexadecimal operand that a function starts
at binds by address. The address form exists because parking by name is not
always expressible. The park is the callee's `FunctionSymbol`, and the READ side
— `ArchContext::callee_proto_pieces`, which `ActionDefaultParams` consults per
call site — is keyed by the callee's ENTRY ADDRESS. Before this canonicalization,
a PE import thunk and the IAT slot it jumps to were two FunctionSymbols with the
same name, the global by-name query answered with the slot while every direct
call targeted the thunk, and the directive was accepted, reported `applied`, and
read back as nothing. An explicit address also goes through
`Architecture::set_function_prototype_pieces_at`, the same address-keyed door the
DWARF and demangled-signature passes use. `pieces.name` is set to the resolved
function's own display name, so an address operand states a signature without
renaming the function to its VMA. A `0x`-prefixed operand that starts no function
is REJECTED with the address in the detail rather than parked under a key nothing
reads: `0x…` is not a C identifier, so such a directive is provably inert, and an
accepted-and-inert directive is the one failure an agent cannot see. A bare hex
token is ambiguous with an identifier (`abc` is both), so it takes the address
path only when it resolves and nothing of that name exists, and never errors.
The same resolution serves the cross-function `param <func>::<i>` /
`return <func>::<storage>` qualifier.

(kuna) **A by-address selection installs its own symbol, so a directive can name
it.** `load addr <vma>` builds the `Funcdata` and follows flow from an address
without installing a `FunctionSymbol` there (the symbol-table `addFunction` is a
later boundary), which is fine for printing C and fatal for the assertion plane:
the resolution above reads the symbol table, so `kuna decompile <bin> 0x401571
--assert 'prototype 0x401571 …'` emitted the function in full and answered
`rejected: no function starts at 0x401571` — the address it had just decompiled —
while the identical directive bound the moment the same run selected the function
BY NAME. Pointing `--addr` at an address claims a lift entry, but does not
override loader knowledge that the address is an import pointer. The generated
script ensures a symbol exists
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/decompile/script.rs (build_script_for_input, selected_vma)` ->
`function symbol <vma>` -> `ConsoleProgram::ensure_function_symbol`) between the
caller's own `--define-function` declarations and the program-scoped directives.
It is the symbol-table half of `--define-function <start>`, and it is skipped
when the caller declared that start themselves, whose extent a second bare
declaration would clear back to unbounded. Only an explicit declaration records
body provenance; the implicit symbol cannot turn an IAT word into code. The
symbol is the SELECTION's alone: an operand naming some other address that starts
no function is still
rejected, which is the only signal an agent gets that a directive is inert
(`docs/re-needs/prototype-assertion-rejects-explicit.md`). Installing the symbol
preserves why that address exists — an import's synthetic address stays an
`UndefinedExternal`, so an addressed import keeps answering with its
external-symbol note rather than `not mapped in this input` — and folds the
ARM/Thumb mode bit out of the address, so the declaration lands where every later
resolution of it looks.

(kuna) **The C the assertion plane accepts is the C it prints.** Six directives
carry a C declaration, and every one of them goes through the console's
C-declaration grammar (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/grammar.rs (CParse)`),
a port of upstream's `grammar.y`. Upstream has no scalar keywords at all: a base
type is whatever `TypeFactory::findByName` answers, so only Ghidra's own `int4` /
`uint8` / `float8` core-type names parse. kuna's printer, though, spells those
types the way the target's own compiler would (§9,
`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p9_emit/kuna_ctypes.rs`), which left the two
halves speaking different languages: a declaration kuna had just emitted could
not be pasted back at it, and the manual's own example
(`prototype authenticate int authenticate(char *user,char *pass)`) was rejected
as a syntax error.

The grammar therefore also accepts the standard C scalar specifiers
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/grammar.rs (CParse::scalar_specifier)`):
`void`, `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `signed`, `unsigned`,
`_Bool` and `wchar_t`, in any legal combination and in every position a type may
appear — a return type, a parameter, a `type` / `param` / `return` / `data`
operand, a struct field. A run of these keywords names ONE base type, and its
width is read from the compiler spec's `<data_organization>` rather than from a
fixed table, so `long` is eight bytes on LP64 and four on LLP64 — the same
source, read the same way, that §9's speller prints them back out from. A
combination that is not a C type (`short long`, `float int`, three `long`s) is
rejected by name rather than as a bare syntax error, and a keyword whose width
the compiler spec never declared names nothing on that target and is rejected
too, rather than resolving to a zero-sized type.

The Ghidra vocabulary is untouched and still wins: a run of exactly one keyword
is resolved by `findByName` first, so `void`, `char` and any host-supplied type
that happens to be spelled with a keyword resolve to exactly the interned type
they always did. Only combinations, and the keywords the type factory does not
name, take the width-driven path.

(kuna) **A tag survives being declared.** `findByName` is also how the lexer
classifies every other identifier, so the moment `struct JSValue { … };` interns
the tag, `JSValue` stops reaching the parser as an identifier and comes back as
a type name. Upstream's `struct_or_union_specifier` reads its tag from the
identifier terminal alone, which made the second mention of any struct — `struct
JSValue` as a return type, a parameter, a field — a bare syntax error, while a
typedef alias for the same structure worked. The tag position therefore accepts
a type name as well (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/grammar.rs
(CParse::tag_identifier)`), and `enum` reads its tag the same way. The position
is unambiguous: a type name after `struct`, `union` or `enum` matched no
production before, with or without a body. Which type the tag names is still
decided by the construction action, not by the token — `oldStruct` rejects a tag
that names something other than a struct with the kind error it always had, so
`struct int4` is refused for saying `struct`, not for being unparseable.

(kuna) **A name that is also a type name is still a name.** The same
`findByName` classification reaches the declarator, where C says the identifier
being declared hides any type of that spelling. Upstream's `direct_declarator`
reads only the identifier terminal, so a variable or parameter named after an
interned type was a syntax error with the caret on its own name — and `code`,
one of the core types every compiler spec registers, is also the word an agent
reaches for when it declares an interpreter's instruction stream. The same
collision covers a tag or typedef declared earlier in the run, and on a `-g`
binary every DWARF type name the program uses. Two positions therefore admit a
type name: the specifier run stops at one once it has already named a type
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/grammar.rs
(CParse::declaration_specifier_starts)`, and its `specifier_qualifier_list`
twin inside a struct body), and the name position takes it
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/grammar.rs (CParse::declarator_identifier)`),
which together cover `unsigned char code`, `unsigned char *code`, `int4
(*code)(void)`, a struct field, an enum constant and the tail of a `a::b`
scoped name. Only the *unparenthesised* name position moved: `int4 (code)` is
genuinely ambiguous in C and keeps its abstract reading, a function of one
`code`. Every declaration that parsed before parses to the same type — the
first specifier of a run is unchanged, so `code *p` is still a pointer to
`code`, and the two positions that changed were both hard errors ("Syntax
error" and "Multiple type specifiers") before.

(kuna) **A `prototype` declaration may name its calling convention**, which is
the other half of speaking the target's own C: on Windows every declaration
worth pasting carries one. An identifier the loaded compiler spec registered as
a prototype model is classified as a function specifier rather than as a bare
identifier (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/grammar.rs
(CParse::lookup_identifier)`, upstream's `glb->hasModel`), so `__stdcall`,
`__cdecl`, `__fastcall` and `__thiscall` parse on an x86 Windows target and
`MSABI` or `syscall` parse on x86-64 gcc — while a spelling the spec does not
declare stays an identifier and the declaration is still rejected, so a
misremembered name cannot be silently dropped. C admits the specifier in two
positions and both are accepted: before the return type (`int __fastcall
f(int)`) and in declarator position, after the return type's `*` and before the
name (`void * __stdcall LoadLibraryExW(...)`, the spelling Windows headers and
Ghidra's own listings use, which the C-standard specifier run cannot reach
because it ends at the `*`). The same allowance covers a parenthesised
declarator, so the callback shape `int (__stdcall *cb)(int)` parses too. Naming
two conventions in one declaration is the error `addFuncSpecifier` already had a
diagnostic for, `Multiple parameter models`.

Where the named convention goes is §4: it is resolved against the architecture's
model registry and rides with the parked prototype, so the declared function's
parameter storage — and, for a callee, the storage a *caller* reads its arguments
out of — is assigned under the convention the operator declared rather than
under the target's default.

A directive that names no function binds to the function being decompiled, which
is unambiguous only when the run selected exactly one; on a whole-binary run it
would silently mean *every* function that happens to have a `v2`, so it is
rejected there with a detail naming the `<func>::<operand>` form. Rejecting is the
design: every directive produces exactly one row in the run's report
(`ConsoleProgram::assertion_outcomes`, serialized as the `assertions` array of
every `--json` document and spoken on stderr on the human surface), because a
directive that is accepted and does nothing is worse for an agent than one that
errors. `--assert-strict` turns any rejection into a non-zero exit; without it a
rejection is reported and the run continues, so a batch of forty renames against a
re-decompiled binary does not lose the other thirty-nine to one stale name.
One class of rejection is fatal without it, and the report marks it `fatal`: a
directive the pipeline ACCEPTED and then REFUSED while applying it. A rename that
did not bind leaves a correct body one annotation short, and the caller can see
which one; a refused `flow` override leaves C that describes a control-flow graph
other than the one asked for, looking exactly as healthy as the C the caller
wanted, so silence there is the failure this plane exists to end.
Durability is caller-carried, as it is for boundaries: `--assert @FILE` is the
artifact.

A `flow` directive is the sharpest of the four function-scoped ones, and the only
one that changes which bytes are in the function at all. P2 classifies the flow
out of each instruction — branch, call, call-that-does-not-return, return — and
`FlowInfo::process` consults the per-function `Override` store
(`has_flow_override`/`get_flow_override`, then `Funcdata::overrideFlow`) before it
decides. The directive seeds that store: `assertions::seed_one` resolves the
address in the default code space, maps the caller's word through
`Override::string_to_type` (rejecting anything outside `branch`, `call`,
`callreturn`, `return` with a reason rather than dropping it), and parks the pair
in `FunctionSeed::flow_overrides`, which
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/project.rs (decompile_targets)` appends to the
derived overrides it already carries — the analysis's `call error(nonzero,…)`
no-return prunes — so a caller-stated fact wins the map insert at an address both
name. The script surface reaches the same store through the ported console
command (`kuna-console/src/ifacedecomp.rs (IfcFlowOverride)`), whose facts the
console re-seeds on every IR rebuild; the two surfaces render the same C. Because
the override is read at flow time, a type the engine cannot honour at that
instruction — `call` at an indirect call, which has no destination to make direct —
raises `Could not apply flowoverride`. That refusal REJECTS the directive; it does
not discard the function. `Funcdata::overrideFlow` gives up before it rewrites any
opcode, so the IR that follows is the one the same run without the directive would
have produced: `FlowInfo::process` records the refused `(instruction, flow type,
reason)` on the `Funcdata` (`note_rejected_flow_override`) and flow follows on.
Both surfaces then read that record back — the in-process one directly
(`assertions::record_rejected_flow_overrides`), the script one from the
`Rejected <command>: <reason>` line the console prints under the `decompile`
(`IfcDecompile`) — and turn it into the directive's `rejected` row, which is
`fatal`. This is the one refusal a caller cannot see in the output, so the C comes
back and the exit code carries the verdict. Aborting instead deleted whole
recovered bodies, and on the script surface it deleted them silently: nothing
looks for a `decompile` that raised, so the run exited 0 with the printer's
"structured blocks unavailable" shell and an empty stderr while `--json`, driving
the same engine in process, exited 1 on the same command. Every per-function abort
is now stamped onto the retained `Funcdata` (`set_kuna_pipeline_failure`) so that
shell names its reason, and the script surface reports the raised abort the way it
already reported the swallowed one.

A `call` (or `callreturn`) override carries one more fact with it: the RET-call
chain it starts. `push <continuation>; push <target>; ret` is a call spelled
without a `call` instruction — the `ret` pops `<target>`, and the callee returns
to `<continuation>`, which is the address of the instruction right after the
`ret`. A body built out of them is one such `ret` per callee, and reclassifying
one link is not enough: P2 resumes at the continuation exactly as it should, meets
the next link's `ret`, and ends the flow there, so everything past the first
recovered call is dead and prints as `return;`. The caller gets one call and no
evidence the chain exists. So both surfaces extend the directive before they seed
it (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/kuna_retcallchain.rs
(kuna_chain_sites)`): a straight-line walk from the function's entry decodes each
instruction through a `PcodeEmit` that records each raw op and how the
instruction leaves, follows an unconditional direct branch, falls through
ordinary instructions, and stops at conditional or indirect control flow. A
single scanned path cannot prove that stores after a conditional dominate a
later RETURN. At each `CPUI_RETURN`, a deliberately small affine provenance
walk must prove that RETURN's destination came from a LOAD of a slot written in
the current straight-line run, and that the immediately adjacent continuation
slot contains this `ret`'s OWN fall-through address. Address equality alone is
not evidence: `push $next; add $word,sp; ret` discarded the matching slot, and a
store of `$next` to unrelated memory does not feed RETURN. An ordinary epilogue
has no in-run store feeding its popped value. A real `call` clears all
provenance because its callee may mutate the stack and volatile registers. The
walk clears provenance at every accepted link,
stops at the first `ret` that fails the test, at an indirect branch, at a decode
failure, at an address it has already decoded, and at the site/instruction caps;
and it reports nothing at all
unless the overridden address is itself one of the links it found, so a `flow
<addr> call` anywhere in ordinary code extends to nothing. The affine state
tracks COPY and constant INT_ADD/INT_SUB through the stack register, exact
STORE/LOAD slot identity including the p-code input-0 memory-space ID, overlap
invalidation, and the final RETURN input.
Constants used in affine arithmetic are sign-extended from their p-code
varnode width, so `[eax-4]` aliases the continuation at `entrySP-4` instead of
becoming a distant positive address. Register invalidation is byte-overlap
aware: a partial write to SP invalidates ESP-derived values and store facts.
An unknown pointer store clears remembered store facts; an unsupported
`CALLOTHER` clears all remembered provenance. Both the
ported console command and the in-process seed run it, so the script and
`--json` surfaces render the same C. Measured on the round-9 witness (`docs/re-needs/
flow-call-override-retain.md`): one directive against a 22-link body, which went
from `LoadLibraryA(s_40151e);` to the whole self-unpacking sequence.

The same bounded walk recognizes a chain reached from the function entry
without a directive (`kuna_entry_chain_sites`) when the P2
`entryretdispatch` option is on (default on, DIV-168). Before the shared
decompile step follows flow, every recognized link without an explicit caller
fact is seeded as `call`. Caller-stated flow classifications own their sites;
in particular, explicit `flow <site> return` vetoes an automatic CALL and is
not redundantly sent to the engine as a RETURN override on a raw RETURN. This
is deliberately not a general computed-RETURN conversion. A plain `ret`, a `ret N`, a return
through the incoming return-address word, a discarded exact-fall-through push,
an unrelated exact-fall-through store, and a computed return whose source lacks
the adjacent in-run store pair produce no sites and keep RETURN semantics. The
console's prefollowed-IR fast path is declined only when
the enabled entry scan finds a link, because that IR was followed before the
derived calls were known. `option entryretdispatch off` restores the first-RET
termination while leaving explicit `flow <site> call` chain propagation
available. The site and instruction caps, continuation clearing, opaque-flow
stops, and multi-link behavior are the same code as the explicit override path
rather than a second recognizer.

The same provenance has a separate one-store classification under
`pushimmediateret` (default on, DIV-170). When RETURN pops the sole current-run
stack store and that exact store is an immediate, the shared decompile step
seeds BRANCH rather than CALL, with no fall-through and without registering the
target as a function. A second same-stack store declines so the adjacent-pair
form above cannot be stolen. As with `entryretdispatch`, any caller-supplied
flow fact at the RET wins; explicit RETURN is a clean veto. The complete P2
proof and negative boundary are specified in chapter
[02 — Lift & flow recovery](02-lift-and-flow.md).

A `readonly` range is the one directive whose effect depends on a second switch:
folding a read-only load into the value behind it is
`ActionVarnodeProps`/`Funcdata::fillin_read_only`, gated on the program-wide
`readonly` option, which is default-off. Asserting a range therefore turns that
option on for the run — a directive that paints a property and then declines to
act on it would be the accepted-and-inert failure this plane exists to end — and
it is applied ahead of the caller's own `--option`s, so an explicit `--option
readonly off` still wins. The reverse composition is not equivalent: the option
alone folds only what the loader already marked (section flags), which is why
`.data` that nothing writes needs the range and not the switch.

There is deliberately no `global` directive. `global add`/`global remove` are the
console commands `phases.toml` names as the `code-data-partition` exposure and
they are wired here onto `Database::add_range`/`remove_range`, but every stock
cspec's `<global>` already claims the whole default data space (`<range
space="ram"/>`), so on any ordinary image an added range was global before the
caller spoke; only the removal direction moves the C. Exposing an assertion that
is measurably a no-op would be the same failure the plane is built to avoid.

(kuna) **Load-time env bridges.** Loader gates are consumed *inside* the
bootstrap — before any console `option` line can possibly run — so the option
surface alone cannot deliver them; each is bridged through a process environment
variable exported first. Both CLI paths use the bindings and value conversions
in `decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/loadtime.rs (binding, settings)`:
`apply_to_command` configures the console subprocess, and `apply_to_process`
temporarily configures the in-process loader. Repeated options keep their final
value. An omitted option leaves the inherited environment alone; an explicit
disabled `macho-arm64e` removes its variable. `LoadtimeEnv` restores inherited
values, including non-Unicode values, when the load returns or unwinds. The
conversions preserve each loader's accepted tokens and fallback behavior;
runtime option validation remains separate.

The default-on and opt-in boolean loader gates share
`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/options.rs (env_toggle)`.
They trim Unicode whitespace and compare ASCII case-insensitively: `off`, `0`
and `false` disable; `on`, `1`, `true` and the empty string enable. Missing,
non-Unicode or unrecognized values retain that gate's default. Gates with
different vocabularies, such as relocatable-object loading, keep their own
conversion rules; these permissive loader tokens do not change the strict
runtime `on_or_off` parser.

## 0.3 The IR substrate

Partition lookup in `decompiler/crates/kuna-base/src/partmap.rs
(PartMap::get_value_mut)` returns the value at the greatest split point no
larger than the query, or the default value before the first split. Mutable
lookup handles the default interval first, then borrows the preceding tree
entry directly. It neither clones the split key nor creates split points.

Opcode-name lookup in `decompiler/crates/kuna-num/src/opcodes.rs` searches the
existing name-index table and returns immediately on an exact match. Lookup
is case-sensitive, retains the SLEIGH aliases, skips `BLANK`, and rejects
`UNUSED1` when converting a matched index to an opcode. Enum values and wire
names are unchanged.

Complement lookup returns the complementary opcode and writes whether its
inputs must be swapped. An opcode with no defined complement returns
`CPUI_MAX` without changing the caller's reordering flag.

Integer bit queries in `decompiler/crates/kuna-base/src/address.rs` use Rust's
primitive bit operations. Least- and most-significant-set-bit queries return
`-1` for zero; population count returns zero and leading-zero count returns 64.
The 128-bit operations in
`decompiler/crates/kuna-num/src/multiprecision.rs` convert little-endian limb
pairs to native `u128` values for unsigned comparisons, wrapping addition and
subtraction, and division. Division retains its 64-bit and smaller-numerator
shortcuts. A zero divisor still panics when the numerator fits in 64 bits and
returns the existing low-level error for a wider numerator, without modifying
the result arrays.

Floating-point constant evaluation uses `decompiler/crates/kuna-num/src/float.rs`
(`FloatFormat`). Finite arithmetic uses host `f64`; NaN payloads are canonical.
Square root, ceiling, floor, and rounding preserve an input NaN's sign;
negation flips it and absolute value clears it. Binary arithmetic takes the
first NaN operand's sign in p-code input order. Operations on non-NaN inputs
that produce NaN use the negative quiet encoding pinned by the x86 golden
oracle. This policy is explicit because Rust arithmetic does not guarantee a
NaN result's sign, even across optimization levels of the same compiler.

The per-function IR is one container, `Funcdata`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata.rs (Funcdata)`), owning
slotmap arenas keyed by three generational id newtypes — `VarnodeId`, `OpId`,
`BlockId` (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/context.rs`). Where the
C++ original links objects with raw pointers, kuna links them with arena keys: a
stale handle is a caught lookup failure, not a use-after-free. The arenas are the
varnode bank (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/varnode.rs
(VarnodeBank)` — storage-sorted def/free/input trees), the op bank
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/op.rs (PcodeOpBank)` — a
`SeqNum`-keyed optree, whose stable key order is what lets a rule-pool cursor
survive op deletion, §0.6, and which counts its own insertions and removals in an
*epoch* so a holder of cached successor ids can tell in O(1) whether the tree
still orders the way it did — `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/op.rs
(optree_epoch, ops_after_seq)`), and **two** block graphs
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/block.rs (BlockGraph)`): `bblocks`,
the CFG, and `sblocks`, the structuring tree — physically distinct, seeded as a
`BlockCopy` mirror of the CFG when structuring begins
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata.rs (seed_sblocks_copy)`).

Registering an input varnode also applies the prototype's saved-register and
return-address effects. This is unconditional registration behavior, not a
separate feature gate; `funcdata_varnode.rs (apply_input_effect_marking)` uses
the canonical `fspec.rs (effect_type)` values rather than maintaining copies.

The varnode bank's two sorted trees are the container the decompiler touches most
— a large function creates and destroys well over a million Varnodes, each one
inserted into and removed from both — so their keys
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/varnode.rs (LocKey, DefKey)`) do not
store an `Address` or a `SeqNum` directly. They store the ordering triple those
compare by, flattened into plain integers: the sentinel rank, the space index and
the offset (`decompiler/crates/kuna-base/src/address.rs (Address::sort_key)`).
Lexicographic comparison of the triple reproduces `Address::cmp` exactly — two
Addresses sharing a space pointer share a rank and an index and fall through to
the offset, which is what the pointer-equality fast path does — so the tree order
is the C++ comparator's order, while the key itself becomes `Copy`: no reference
counting on clone or drop, no pointer chase into an `AddrSpace` to compare, and a
smaller node. Insertion also takes a single descent
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/varnode.rs (VarnodeBank::xref)`):
the "is an equivalent varnode already present" lookup and the insertion that
follows it are the same search, because the `insert` flag set afterwards is
outside the `(input|written)` mask the key is built from and so cannot move the
entry.

Read-only block queries walk the stored Varnode descendants without copying
them. Common-subexpression lookup returns the first eligible equal op in that
sequence; earliest-use lookup instead compares block-local op order. The common
subexpression query still checks its op, Varnode and optional cutoff before
walking descendants, including when the descendant list is empty.

Nonzero-mask propagation appends descendants directly to its local worklist
after updating the output mask. Stored descendant order and duplicate reads
are preserved; iterating the successors does not mutate the IR. The initial
alive-op snapshot remains because the depth-first walk updates op marks.

Every cross-arena mutation routes through `Funcdata` — Rust cannot hold two
`&mut` arenas through a method on one of them, so the op-in-block primitives the
C++ splits between `Funcdata` and `BlockBasic` are all `Funcdata` methods here
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata.rs (bb_insert_op,
bb_remove_op)`).

**Phi arity tracks in-degree, and the marker run is not a place to look it up.**
A basic block's MULTIEQUALs carry one input per in-edge, in edge order, so CFG
surgery that severs an edge must drop the matching slot from every phi in the
target — `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata_block.rs
(branch_remove_internal, block_remove_internal)`. Both scan the target's whole op
list for the opcode rather than walking the leading run of markers and stopping at
the first op that is not one, because that run is not stable: a phi can be
rewritten into an ordinary op **in place**, keeping its position among the markers
— `op_zero_multi` turns a 1-input MULTIEQUAL into a COPY, and the stack-pointer
solve rewrites a solved phi into an `INT_ADD`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p6_variables/coreaction_stackptr.rs
(analyze_extra_pop)`). A resync that stopped there would leave the phis behind it
claiming an edge the block no longer has, and the next pass to index a phi slot as
an in-edge — `descend2_undef`, reached from the unreachable-block sweep — would
read past the end of the edge list.

**The impl map.** `Funcdata` is one struct whose `impl` blocks are split by the
phase that owns the mutation — the split is itself the documentation of which
phase mutates what (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata.rs`,
module docs):

| impl block | owns |
|---|---|
| `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata.rs` | construction, arenas, flags, `clear` |
| `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata_op.rs` | op creation/mutation primitives |
| `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata_varnode.rs` | varnode creation/lookup primitives |
| `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata_block.rs` | CFG surgery + the jump-table drivers |
| `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata_encode.rs`, `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata_printraw.rs` | marshaling, raw printing |
| `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p2_lift/funcdata_resolveflow.rs` | flow resolution (P2) |
| `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p5_types/funcdata_union.rs` | union facet resolution (P5) |
| `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p6_variables/funcdata_facing.rs`, `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p6_variables/funcdata_merge.rs`, `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p6_variables/funcdata_spacebase.rs` | variable/merge/stack tiers (P6) |
| `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p9_emit/coreaction_casts.rs` | cast insertion hooks (P9) |

Freeing a Varnode takes it out of the HighVariable that lists it, as the C++
`~Varnode` does, whichever primitive frees it: `destroy_varnode`, and the dead
Varnodes the dead-code pass clears
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata_varnode.rs
(clear_dead_varnodes)`). Once variables are merged, an input a late repair left
unread is cleared there; left in its variable, it is a stale member the naming
pass reads.

**Data types are shared IR, not per-function state.** The type factory
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/dtype.rs (TypeFactoryImpl)`) is one
`Rc` owned by the engine and shared into every per-function handle
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/architecture.rs (build_arch_handle)`),
so a type interned while decompiling one function — or committed by a prototype
lock — is the same object every later function resolves. Chapter 05 owns the
lattice; here it only matters that `Datatype` handles cross function boundaries
and IR arenas do not.

## 0.4 The knowledge plane (P0)

P0 is everything that outlives a function's IR — the plane a restart re-reads
and an agent writes:

- **The symbol database** (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/database.rs
  (Database, Scope)`): symbols in a namespace-scoped hierarchy, mapped to storage
  by range-tree `SymbolEntry`s, plus the boolean property map (read-only /
  volatile paint). Populated by the loader-symbol read and the analysis commit
  (§0.1); queried by name, address, containment, or property, walking the scope
  chain exactly as the upstream `stack*` helpers do.
  A qualified symbol name is nested by splitting it on every `::`
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/database.rs
  (find_create_scope_from_symbol_name)`), one Scope per component, and an **empty**
  component — `a::::b`, `::b` — cannot name a Scope: `attach_scope` rejects it.
  That rejection is raised while the loader symbols are being installed, i.e.
  inside the architecture build, so it does not cost one symbol — it escapes the
  build, and every command answers `could not build an architecture for <binary>:
  Non-global scope has empty name` and emits nothing. (Answering with the reason
  attached is what DIV-90 gave the subprocess surface, which until then replaced
  it with a fixed string — so this symptom, which `docs/options.md` publishes as
  the trigger for flipping `symbolnamerepair`, was unmatchable from the surface an
  agent is most likely driving.) Symbol-name bytes are attacker-controlled data
  that no header check
  validates, which makes that a denial-of-analysis primitive a hostile binary can
  buy for a few `.strtab` bytes. `symbolnamerepair` (on|off, default on;
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_symbolnamerepair.rs`) skips
  the degenerate component instead, so the symbol keeps the rest of its scope path
  and the load survives; only the empty component is treated as degenerate, since
  every other string names a Scope perfectly well however strange it looks. Off
  restores the hard error, which is what someone investigating a binary's symbol
  table itself wants to see. Like the other gates consumed inside `load file`
  (`relocrebase`, `i386_pie_plt`, `typedepth`) it is read through a process
  environment variable rather than an `Architecture` flag, because `option` is
  applied downstream of the load it would have to govern.
  The scope path is not the only thing a name's bytes reach: the same string is
  printed into emitted C, and nothing on the way validates it.
  `symbolnamechars` (off|safe|ident, default safe;
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_symbolnamechars.rs`) is the
  character half of the same problem, and it sanitizes at the mint rather than at
  the printer for a reason that is about the control surface: `kuna decompile
  <name>`, the console's `load function` and the DB scope path all key on the
  string the symbol table holds, so a printer-side rewrite would put a name in
  the `.c` that cannot be handed back. Chapter 01 §1.1 states the byte-level
  behavior; here it only matters that the name in `prog.symbols`, in `kuna
  functions`, in the `.c`/`.h`/`.asm` export and in the Scope chain is ONE
  string, and that it is decided before the symbol reaches this database.
  The same split is also a **resource** seam, and a second gate bounds it.
  Nothing limited how many components a name could have, and a `Scope` is not
  cheap — a range list, three ordered maps, two strings and a per-address-space
  map table, about 1.5 KB resident — so one name bought one `Scope` per `::`
  without limit, and the interning key includes the parent, so even a repeated
  component name allocated a fresh `Scope` at every level. That made a symbol
  name a roughly 498-fold input-to-RSS amplifier: 600 KB of `.strtab` in a single
  name cost 292 MB, and the whole-binary path is quadratic in depth on top of
  that, so tens of kilobytes already bought a stall of tens of seconds.
  `symbolnamebound` (`<n>|off`, default 256;
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_symbolnamebound.rs`) caps
  the scope-component count, and with it each component's length and the whole
  scope path's length. A name over a limit is **folded**, not truncated: the
  dropped run of components collapses into one synthetic component carrying a
  hash of the exact bytes it replaced, so two names that differed only inside the
  folded region still differ, and two symbols that share a scope path but differ
  in their base name still share the folded scope. The base name is never
  rewritten — it nests no `Scope`, so it was never the amplifier. The hash is
  written out in the module rather than taken from the standard library's default
  hasher, whose per-process seed would make the folded spelling differ between
  runs and turn every golden comparison into noise. The fold is applied
  identically on the **read** path
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/database.rs
  (resolve_scope_from_symbol_name)`) and at the loader's own name list, and it is
  idempotent, so a symbol installed under a folded path is addressable by the name
  the binary spells *and* by the name the listing renders, and one spelling
  reaches every surface. The defaults are set from measurement, not from taste:
  over 1,683,515 demangled names — the repo fixtures, fourteen large C++ objects,
  nine rustc-built binaries, and the sixty largest system objects — the deepest
  `::` nesting is 21 (a Rust name; C++ never exceeds 6), and over the DWARF names
  of a rustc binary it is 79, because the DWARF path does not strip template
  arguments and every `::` inside `<…>` counts. The longest scope component is
  exactly 256 bytes, which is where rustc's own mangler truncates, and the longest
  name of all, 1,780 bytes, carries no `::` at all and so is not a scope path in
  the first place. The ceilings sit at 256, 1024 and 4096, three to four times
  above each, and the fold is therefore unreachable in practice; `off` restores
  the unbounded behavior exactly, for reproducing a report.
  The bound caps what **one name** costs, not what a symbol **table** costs.
  The amplifier is per-`Scope`, so the same `.strtab` bytes spent on many
  moderately deep names buy the same memory — 3,000 distinct 64-component names,
  1.9 MB of ELF, cost 343 MB with the gate on or off, since none of them reaches
  the ceiling and none of their scopes can be shared. Closing that needs a cap on
  the total `Scope` population, or a cheaper `Scope`; what this gate closes is
  the reported primitive, one name turning 600 KB of `.strtab` into 292 MB, and
  the quadratic whole-binary blowup that rode on it. Same loader-tier env
  bridge as `symbolnamerepair`, and deliberately a
  separate gate from it: turning the repair off is a debugging affordance for
  someone inspecting a symbol table, and that must not also remove a resource
  bound.
- **The Override store** (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/overrides.rs
  (Override)`): per-function commands that override pipeline decisions — flow
  reclassification, direct-call redirects, prototype replacement, multistage
  jump-table requests, dead-code delays, forced gotos. Its defining property is
  that it **survives `Funcdata::clear`**
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/funcdata.rs (clear)` resets the
  arenas and analysis state but not the override store): a mid-pipeline pass that
  discovers a decision too late writes the correction here and requests a
  restart, and the restarted run reads it back (§0.7).
- **The typed assertion facade** (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_assert.rs
  (validate_assertion, Dispatch)`) (kuna): `kassert <phase> <subphase> …`
  validates a request against the phase registry, computes the *reported* minimal
  rewind scope, logs it, and routes it to whichever battle-tested store already
  implements it (Override, proto locks, retype/rename, an option). It adds a
  model over the stores, not a new mechanism.
- **The option surface** (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/options.rs
  (OptionDatabase, KUNA_OPTION_NAMES)`): upstream options dispatch by registered
  element id through `OptionDatabase::set`; the kuna-added options are an
  allowlisted name set routed to
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_option_dispatch.rs
  (set_kuna_option)`, which writes the live flag the consuming pass reads.
  The handler declaration generates both the dispatch and its name allowlist;
  adding a handler cannot leave those two out of sync. Catalog metadata remains
  independent, so `kuna catalog --check` compares the documented options against
  the implemented handlers. The machine-readable
  catalog rows — values, defaults, tier, symptoms, flip guidance — are generated
  into `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_phases.rs
  (SETTABLE_TABLE, emit_catalog_json)` from `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/phases.toml`
  by `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/build.rs`. The build uses the TOML parser
  with a typed schema in `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/build/registry.rs`:
  row order is preserved, required fields have explicit types, and duplicate or
  unknown fields are rejected. Live mappings must supply all three fields or
  none. The rendered catalog is
  [docs/options.md](../options.md) and this spec never duplicates its metadata.
  The CLI parses catalog JSON with the standard JSON parser while preserving
  field order, duplicate keys, and number spellings for its existing renderers.
  Conversion is bounded to 128 nested containers and rejects malformed or trailing
  content. The parity command separately validates its baseline's required
  string-valued passing set: invalid records are errors, not empty expectations.
  CLI JSON rendering uses one traversal for compact, indented and sorted output
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-cli/src/jsonfmt/writer.rs`). Numeric tokens retain
  their original spelling; string escaping remains ASCII-safe, including UTF-16
  surrogate pairs for non-BMP characters. Unsorted objects borrow their stored
  field order directly. Sorted output orders borrowed field references stably,
  preserving duplicate-key order, and applies the same policy to nested objects.
- **Modes (option presets)** (kuna)
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/modes.rs (MODE_TABLE, mode_overrides)`,
  applied by `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/architecture.rs (apply_mode)`):
  a *mode* is a named, ordered list of `(option, value)` overrides layered over the
  shipped defaults — a P0 pipeline-variant preset over the option surface, **not** a
  `[[settable]]` row (it references existing option names, so it never touches the
  catalog or its count/tier gates). Three concrete presets ship:
  **`reliable`** (the shipped defaults, an empty-override alias),
  **`aggressive`** (every off-by-default recovery/analysis pass on, except
  `v850indirectbranch`, which would mis-decode register-indirect calls off-V850,
  `dwarf_lines`, which annotates rather than recovers and would bury a `-g`
  binary's body in `/* src.c:NNN */` comments; the exclusion list is enforced by an invariant test in
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/modes.rs`, so a default-off
  option is either in the preset or listed there with its reason),
  and **`fast`** (`listing`, `funcstart_patterns`, and `aif` off to avoid
  program-wide decode and speculative discovery). A fourth frontend policy,
  **`auto`**, resolves from the raw input length before the Architecture is
  built: `<500 KiB` selects `aggressive`, `500 KiB–<2 MiB` selects `reliable`,
  and `>=2 MiB` selects `fast`. File-based CLI commands use `auto` when
  `--mode` is omitted; the WASI/browser frontend uses the same Rust classifier.
  The interactive console accepts concrete `mode <name>` presets but cannot
  apply unresolved `auto`, because an Architecture has no input-file metadata.
  Overrides are applied *before* the user's `--option` (last-write, so an
  explicit `--option` still wins). Discover with `kuna modes`; full membership
  and exact byte boundaries are in [docs/modes.md](../modes.md).
- **The restart log** (kuna)
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_restartlog.rs (RestartLog)`):
  owned by the engine `Architecture` so it survives function clears; every
  restart trigger records *why* (§0.7). Observability only.
- The phase registry itself
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_phases.rs (KunaPhase)`):
  P0–P9 with Band-B membership (`KunaPhase::in_band_b` — P3..P6), queryable at
  the console. The model behind it is [docs/phases.md](../phases.md).

**Effective defaults — the single narrative.** A knob's effective value is
layered, in order: (1) the engine default —
`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/architecture.rs (reset_defaults_internal)`
is the *single source*, and the `default` column of
`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/phases.toml` mirrors it (a hard-coded live-default assertion, `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/architecture/tests.rs (kuna_anchor_flags_default_to_div_values)`, pins the engine defaults to the DIV values; the toml column mirrors them by convention); (2)
the file frontend's mode policy (`auto` when omitted) resolves to a concrete
preset, and load-time members plus explicit load-time options are exported
before bootstrap with last-write precedence; (3) per-program loader adjustments
made at bootstrap (e.g. `readonlypropagate` forced on for
MIPS so GOT-slot loads fold to import names,
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/engine.rs (bootstrap_from_object)`);
(4) driver surface injections (`listing`, non-x86-64
`funcstart_patterns`/`aif`, §0.2) for options the concrete preset did not name;
(5) the concrete mode's runtime overrides followed by the user's
`--option`/`kassert` lines (which override the mode); and finally
(6) the per-function snapshot copy (§0.5), after which the value is frozen for that
function's drive.
Which defaults deliberately diverge from upstream, and the measurements behind
each flip, live in `docs/history.md`, not here.

## 0.5 The two Architecture types

There are two types named "architecture", and confusing them is the classic way
to ship a dead option.

The **engine god object**
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/architecture.rs (Architecture)`) owns
everything program-wide: the SLEIGH translator, the symbol database, the option
and action databases, the user-op and injection libraries, the type factory, the
printer, the restart log, and the whole bag of tuning values.

The **per-function snapshot**
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/context.rs (ArchContext)`) is the
`glb` every `Funcdata` carries (`ArchHandle`, an `Rc<ArchContext>`): the
IR-boundary slice of the god object that passes and rules may reach while the
pipeline holds `&mut Funcdata`. It shares the engine's single address-space
manager, type factory, string manager, and loader by `Rc`, and *copies* the
scalar configuration — every tuning value and (kuna) every rule gate — plus
read-only snapshots of the global symbol scope, callee prototypes, and tracked
registers.

The global-symbol snapshot
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/context.rs (GlobalQuery)`) groups
mapped entries by address-space index once when it is built. Grouping is stable:
the encounter order of entries within one space is unchanged, preserving
`findContainer`'s first-match behavior for equal-size overlaps and its
use-point selection. Within each space, an offset interval index restricts
container candidates to entries whose first offset is at or below the query
start and whose last offset reaches the query end. The final reduction still
uses stable encounter order for equal-size entries, preserves the effect of the
exact-size early break, and applies the original use-point validity test.
Property, naming, container, and callee lookups first isolate the requested
space, so register, stack, and other non-global varnodes do not scan mappings
from unrelated spaces.

The copy happens in exactly one place:
`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/architecture.rs (build_arch_handle)`,
called from `(Architecture::new_funcdata)` when a function's `Funcdata` is
built. Two consequences:

- **The flag-copy hazard** (kuna). A gate a rule reads through the per-function
  handle (`data.get_arch().<flag>`) exists twice — on the god object (where
  `option`/`kassert` writes it) and on `ArchContext` (where the rule reads it).
  If `build_arch_handle` does not copy it, the rule silently reads the
  `ArchContext` constructor default (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/substrate/context.rs
  (ArchContext::new_shared)`) — deliberately `false` for the kuna rule gates, so
  hand-built fixtures keep gated rules inert — regardless of what the option
  surface wrote. The symptom is an option that parses, is confirmed, appears in
  the catalog — and changes nothing. Every new per-function-consumed flag must be threaded
  through `build_arch_handle`.
- **Snapshot timing.** The handle is built once per `Funcdata` and kept for that
  function's whole drive, including restarts (the restart re-flow clears and
  reuses the same `Funcdata`, `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs
  (refollow_flow)`). Options must therefore be in effect before the function is
  built — which the console guarantees by rebuilding a fresh `Funcdata` on every
  `decompile` command, *except* when `decompile` adopts the IR `load function`
  already followed (§0.8), and that adoption is refused the moment any command at
  all — an `option` among them — has run since the load.

(kuna) The tracked-register snapshot is the context database's track base plus the
loader's register seeds for the entry being built
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/architecture.rs (Architecture::loader_entry_tracks)`,
today only the PowerPC64 ELFv1 TOC of §1.3). The seeds are merged into that one
entry's snapshot at this copy rather than written into the track base at load, so a
`set track` issued at any point before the build stays visible, and a register the
live track base already pins at the entry keeps the user's value while the other
seeds are added.

Two of those snapshots — the global-symbol query and the callee-prototype list —
are whole-database derivations, so re-deriving them once per function dominates
per-function cost as soon as the symbol table is large. On an 18 MB Windows PE
with 73,366 mapped globals each pair costs about 25 ms to build and 12 ms to free,
flat in the size of the function being decompiled, and the symbol table it reads
does not move once for the whole run. Both are pure functions of the symbol
database (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/database.rs (Database)`),
so `build_arch_handle` derives them at most once per state of that database and
hands every `Funcdata` a shared `Rc` to the same pair, keyed on a monotone
mutation generation the database bumps in every one of its `&mut self` entry
points (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/database.rs
(kuna_generation)`). A mutation between two function builds — a `map addr`, a
rename, a recovered prototype — moves the generation and both snapshots are
rebuilt on the next build, so what a `Funcdata` sees is still the database as of
its own build and the emitted C does not move.

The reuse is only as sound as that bump, which is why the generation is not
maintained by hand at the call sites that matter: a unit test re-reads the
database source and fails if any `&mut self` method does not open with the bump,
if an `impl Database` block is written in a form that scan cannot enter, or if
interior mutability appears in the database's own types (which would let a
mutation past a `&mut self` scan unseen). `KUNA_NO_SYMBOL_SNAPSHOT_CACHE`
re-derives both snapshots on every handle, so the memoized and re-derived paths
can be compared on any binary.

## 0.6 The schedule

The pipeline's execution order is not the folder order. Every per-function run
executes a single declarative pass tree, `universal_sched`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/universalaction.rs (universal_sched)`,
based on upstream `ActionDatabase::universalAction`, with kuna-specific passes).
The tree is built
once per engine as `SchedNode` values (Action leaf / Pool of rules / Group /
RestartGroup), *filtered* by the root variant's enabled group list
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/action.rs (build_default_groups,
ActionDatabase::set_current)`), and *materialized* into engine objects. Six root
variants exist — `decompile` (34 groups: everything), `jumptable` (12 groups:
only what a reduced flow analysis needs — the switch-recovery sub-decompilation
of §2.3 runs under it), `normalize`, `paramid`, `register`, `firstpass`. A
variant is a filter over the same tree, not a separate pipeline, which is what
makes reduced sub-queries cheap.

The shape, outermost-in: a RestartGroup wraps setup passes (constant-base,
default params, extrapop, prototype seeding, function linking), then
**fullloop**, a repeat-group that iterates until no member reports change. Inside
it, **mainloop** repeats the core sequence: unreachable-block and
varnode-property maintenance, (angr) lowered-switch installation, **heritage**
(SSA construction, §3.1), the prototype phalanx (param-double, direct-write,
active-param, return recovery, local restriction — §4), **dead-code
elimination**, spacebase and non-zero-mask analysis, **type inference** (§5),
varnode restructuring, and then **stackstall**, itself a repeat-group whose heart
is the `oppool1` rule pool — the opcode-indexed worklist of simplification rules
(141 registered in the default tree, plus per-architecture extras) that fires to
a local fixpoint — followed by lane division, CSE, shadow-var elimination, deindirection, and
stack-pointer flow. Mainloop's tail runs redundant-branch removal, block
structuring, constant-pointer recovery, the 5-rule `oppool2` (pointer-arithmetic
forms), determined-branch pruning, node joining, and conditional-execution/
conditional-constant analysis. Phases 3–6 therefore do not run as a sequence:
they co-evolve inside mainloop until mutual quiescence — the Band-B fixpoint
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_phases.rs
(KunaPhase::in_band_b)`). Fullloop's own tail (likely-trash, switch
normalization, (angr) lowered-switch detection and stack-guard stripping, return
splitting and the (angr) return-duplication family, unjustified params, active
return) runs between mainloop convergences.

Only after fullloop exits do the one-shot tails run: the 22-rule cleanup pool,
the merge phalanx (§6), prototype fixation, naming and casts (§9), final
structuring, and (angr) the goto-quality passes (§8.3). A pass that discovers it
has invalidated earlier work does not edit backwards; it requests a restart by
setting the restart-pending flag, having first persisted its lesson into the
knowledge plane (§0.7).

**The restart machinery, as actually implemented** (kuna): the in-tree
RestartGroup (`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/action.rs
(ActionRestartGroup::apply)`, budget `max = 1`) cannot re-follow flow — the
action loop carries only the IR-boundary handle, not the SLEIGH translator — so
it hands every restart up (`ActionContext::reflow_requested`) to the outer drive,
`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs (run_pipeline)`,
which owns `&mut Architecture`: it clears the function (`Funcdata::clear` — the
Override store survives), re-follows flow, and re-performs the root, bounded at 8
cross-flow restarts (`MAX_REFLOW`); past the budget it keeps the last analyzed IR
rather than failing. Restarts are refused outright during jump-table recovery
(`is_jumptable_recovery_on`, same `apply`). The relocation is behavioral
plumbing, not semantics: trigger, clear, re-read-P0, re-run are the upstream
restart contract.

Two engine details are output-affecting and deliberately preserved
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/action.rs`): `Action::perform` is a
resumable status machine (an action with `rule_repeatapply` loops until its
change count stops rising; `rule_onceperfunc` latches done), and
`ActionPool::process_op` walks each op's per-opcode rule list *resetting the walk
to index 0 whenever a rule changes the op's opcode* — rules observe each other's
effects mid-op, and the reset order is part of the observable output. The C++
cursor is a map iterator whose `++` is O(1); kuna models it as the last consumed
`SeqNum` (so it survives the op's own deletion) and reads a short *run* of
successors per tree descent rather than one search per op, discarding the run
whenever the optree epoch above moves — any op created or destroyed by anything
other than the pool's own consumption of the op it just left. The visit order is
the search's, one buffered value at a time.

The `decompile` listing is checked byte-for-byte against a maintained kuna
schedule snapshot, including its added passes, flags, numbering and separators.
It is not an independent C++ oracle. The tests separately pin pass presence and
adjacency, root-filter behavior and the empty `UNPORTED_ALLOWLIST`
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/universalaction.rs`). Snapshot changes
require an intentional schedule change; matching it alone does not prove
decompilation parity, which remains covered by the output regression suites.

Flow-follow itself runs *before* the tree (the upstream `followFlow` →
`startProcessing` order), bounded by the P0 flow options — decode-error policy
`error_toomanyinstructions` and a 100000-instruction ceiling by default
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/architecture.rs
(reset_defaults_internal)`), applied at
`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs (follow_flow_on_fd)`.

**Where a run's time went** (kuna). The schedule can be asked to account for
itself: with `KUNA_ACTION_PROF` set to a path, every `apply` call is timed and
the engine writes an exclusive-time table there
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/actionprof.rs`), rewritten each time
the outermost timing frame closes. A scope guard closes frames on both normal
return and panic unwind, so a caught action panic cannot strand the timing stack
or prevent later actions from publishing. Totals belong to the current thread;
threads and worker processes do not merge their tables when sharing an output
path. File-write failures remain non-fatal. Rendering borrows the accumulated
rows and sorts by descending exclusive time, then by name for ties.
Time is exclusive — a group is charged only what it spends outside its children,
so the rows sum to the schedule's wall time and a container cannot hide a leaf —
and each row is keyed by the root variant it ran under, which is what separates a
function's own `decompile` pass from the reduced `jumptable` pipeline running on
a partial clone beside it. The root label is set where the variant is selected
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/action.rs
(ActionDatabase::set_current)`). This is a measuring instrument, not a decision
point: it changes nothing the engine emits, and with the variable unset it costs
one cached read per `apply`.

## 0.7 Feedback edges

The pipeline is a fixpoint machine wearing a pipeline's clothes. Beyond the
in-tree repeat groups (§0.6), these are the edges where a *later* phase dirties
an *earlier* phase's artifact, what each persists, and where each lives in kuna.
(The mechanism taxonomy — local fixpoint, staged re-entry, restart-with-hints,
reduced sub-query, knowledge-store re-run — derives from the 2026-06 stage-model
study summarized in `docs/history.md`; every row below is re-verified against the Rust.)

| Edge | Mechanism | Trigger | Survives / persisted where | kuna anchor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rule pools → themselves | local fixpoint | any rule fires; opcode change rewinds the per-op rule walk | — | `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/action.rs (ActionPool::process_op)` |
| P2 → P2, jump-table recovery | reduced sub-query | `BRANCHIND` with unrecovered targets mid flow-follow | recovered table → `jumpvec`; the cloned partial is discarded | `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs (run_jumptable_pipeline)`, driven from `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p2_lift/flow.rs (generate_ops_with_jumptables)` |
| Band B → P3/P2, dead-code delay | restart + persisted hint | a free varnode reappears at an already-heritaged address after dead code was removed | `Override::insert_deadcode_delay` (+1) in P0 | `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p3_dataflow/heritage.rs (bump_deadcode_delay)`; suppressed during jump-table recovery (the `is_jumptable_recovery_on` guards at its call sites) |
| P4 → Band B, late prototype | restart + persisted hint | a resolved indirect call's prototype cannot be merged in place (`late_restriction` fails) | `Override::insert_indirect_override` — the re-flow rebuilds the CALLIND as a direct CALL | `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p4_calls/fspec.rs (FuncCallSpecs::deindirect, FuncCallSpecs::force_set)` |
| (angr) P2 → P2, lowered switch | detect-then-restart, two halves | a comparison cascade recognized as a compiler-lowered switch after simplification | the recovered cascade record, in a store shared by both halves | detect in fullloop writes + requests restart, install in mainloop (before heritage) reads on the restarted run — `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p2_lift/kuna_loweredswitch.rs (ActionLowerSwitchDetect, ActionLowerSwitchInstall)` |
| P5 → P2, determined branch | in-loop re-entry | constant folding decides a conditional branch, removing a CFG edge | the simplified ops themselves | `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p3_dataflow/coreaction_early.rs (ActionDeterminedBranch)`, inside mainloop |
| (kuna/angr) P7/P8 structuring fallback | degraded re-run | the region structurer cannot collapse the graph to a single root | nothing; `sblocks` is re-seeded clean | `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p8_structure/blockaction.rs (ActionBlockStructure)` falls back to `CollapseStructure` after `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p8_structure/region_structurer.rs (run_region_structurer)` declines |
| P0 → everything, the outer loop | knowledge-store re-run | an operator/agent writes an assertion (`option`, `kassert`, override) and re-decompiles | the entire P0 store | `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_assert.rs (Dispatch)`; the console rebuilds the IR per `decompile`, re-seeding stashed facts — `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs (decompile_func_full_with_override_dyn)` (§0.8 is when the rebuild is skipped) |

**Not implemented in kuna** (theory-only, kept for the record): the upstream
jump-table *size-mismatch* restart — `matchModel` finding the recovered model's
size differs from the flow-recovered address table would persist
`Override::insertMultistageJump` and restart. In kuna the mismatch keeps the
flow-recovered addresses and does not restart
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p2_lift/jumptable.rs (JumpTable::match_model)`,
a documented stub); the Override store already carries the hint surface
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/overrides.rs
(Override::insert_multistage_jump)`) with no live producer.

Mechanisms are mutually disabling by design: no restart, and no dead-code-delay
bump, fires inside the jump-table sub-decompilation — the sub-query must answer
its one question and be discarded, never mutate P0.

(kuna) Every restart trigger and suppressed trigger records its reason in the
engine-owned restart log
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/p0_knowledge/kuna_restartlog.rs (RestartLog)`),
because a function that silently decompiles twice is otherwise invisible.

## 0.8 One flow follow per decompile

The console has two commands that build IR for a function, and a `kuna decompile
<bin> <fn>` runs both: `load function <fn>` (or `load addr`), then `decompile`.
Upstream follows the flow once — C++ `IfcFuncload` follows it, and `IfcDecompile`
re-runs the action pipeline on *that* `Funcdata` after
`Architecture::clearAnalysis`. kuna's `decompile` instead builds a fresh
`Funcdata` and follows the flow again, because a decompile is seeded with facts
that `load function` never applied — and some of them are consumed AT FLOW TIME,
so re-seeding them onto an already-followed IR would be too late:

- `override prototype` call-site overrides, which `FlowInfo::build_call_specs`
  consumes as it builds the call specs, and every `parse line` prototype re-parked
  on its global `FunctionSymbol` before the drive (a callee prototype the follow
  resolves against). These two are the genuinely flow-time seeds.
- `override flow` facts, likewise consumed at flow time — but `load function`
  seeds these too, from the same store, so the two follows agree on them.
- `map address` symbols and DWARF stack locals, `type varnode %REG(pc)` usepoint
  symbols, `map hash` dynamic symbols, a `parse line extern` prototype for the
  function itself, and `map param` storage locks. The drive re-seeds all of these
  onto the `Funcdata` *after* the follow, so they do not require a re-follow —
  they are nonetheless required absent below, because "no facts at all" is the
  condition that is cheap to prove and impossible to get subtly wrong.

So the rebuild is *required* when a flow-time fact exists, and pure waste when no
fact exists at all — which is every plain `kuna decompile`. The waste is not
small: the second follow repeats the whole lift, the block build, and the
jump-table sub-decompilation (§0.7), which on a large switch-heavy function is the
single most expensive thing the run does.

`decompile` therefore **adopts** the loaded IR when it can prove the rebuild would
repeat the same follow
(`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/ifacedecomp.rs (PristineFlow)`, consumed
through `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/decompile_drive.rs
(decompile_func_full_with_override_dyn_prefollowed)`). Two independent guards must
both hold:

- **Every seed above is empty**, flow-time or re-seeded alike. A flow-time seed
  present means the loaded IR was followed without it, so adopting would silently
  drop it; the re-seeded ones are held to the same bar deliberately, so the guard
  is one question ("did the console learn anything about this function?") rather
  than a per-seed judgement that a later seed could be forgotten from.
- **The architecture is configured as it was at the load.** A `Funcdata`
  snapshots the per-function flags into its ArchSeam handle when it is *built*
  (§0.5), so a flag flipped afterwards is invisible to it. Three things move
  between the load and the drive and therefore refuse adoption: `formatstring
  full`, which turns read-only propagation on around the drive so the printf
  format constant can be read (adopting there leaves `printf((char *)(dat_… + …),
  …)`, the format string unresolved); the watchdog's per-function budget, armed
  inside the drive; and ghidra mode's staged name/dynamic/prototype-model
  recommendations. A parked `formatstring static` override refuses adoption for
  its own function only, in the step itself: the override is consumed at flow
  time, so IR followed before the park does not carry the typing.
- **The `decompile` is the immediately next command.** `load function` records the
  console's command counter
  (`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/src/interface.rs (IfaceStatus::command_seq)`)
  and `decompile` requires it to have advanced by exactly one, along with the same
  name, entry, declared extent and flow overrides. The counter is the whole
  invalidation story on purpose: an `option` that changes a flow-time decision, a
  `kassert`, a `map`, a second `load` — anything at all — advances it, so no
  command needs its own invalidation hook and none can be forgotten.

Adoption is a pure-performance seam: the adopted `Funcdata` is the one the rebuild
would have produced, so the emitted C is byte-identical either way, and
`decompiler/crates/kuna-console/tests/verify_flowreuse.rs` asserts exactly that
(plus that the fast path is really taken, via `IfaceDecompData::adopted_flows`).
The one place the two paths differ is the failure arm: a drive that aborts
consumes the adopted IR, where the rebuild path left the loaded `Funcdata`
untouched for a following `print C`, so the error arm re-follows the recorded
name/entry/size/overrides to put it back.

## 0.9 Reading order

The folder taxonomy is the *artifact* order, not the execution order. Source
under `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src` is arranged as `substrate` (the IR
containers, §0.3), `infra` (scheduler, god object, drive — this chapter),
`p0_knowledge` (§0.4), and `p1_partition` … `p9_emit`, which map 1:1 onto
chapters 01–09 of this spec; the program-preparation tier is
`decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/src` (chapter 01). Execution order is §0.6's
tree — when you need to know *when* a pass runs, read
`decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/universalaction.rs (universal_sched)`
and search for the pass's constructor, never the folder.

Conventions worth knowing before reading anything:

- **Tests ride in sibling directories**: a module `foo.rs` ends with
  `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` and its tests live at `foo/tests.rs` (e.g.
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/universalaction.rs` +
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/universalaction/tests.rs`).
- **C++ citations in code comments** (`decompiler/cpp/<file>.cc`) are upstream
  Ghidra anchors at the pinned `GHIDRA_REV` (`docs/history.md`) — the tree kuna
  was ported from — not paths in this repository.
- **`Funcdata` methods are phase-owned**: find the owning phase through the impl
  map (§0.3) rather than grepping one giant file.
- Option metadata lives in the generated catalog
  ([docs/options.md](../options.md)); the phase model at a glance in
  [docs/phases.md](../phases.md); intentional default divergences, their
  measurements, and the original derivation study in `docs/history.md`.

Suggested order for a first full read: this chapter, then 01 → 02 → 03 (the
world up to SSA), then 04/05/06 as one unit (they converge together, §0.6), then
07 → 08 → 09.
