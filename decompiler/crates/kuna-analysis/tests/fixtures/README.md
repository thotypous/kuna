# ELF test fixtures

Small, real, dynamically-linked ELF binaries used by the loader gates in
`loadimage_object.rs`'s test module (PLT/GOT import-name resolution — see
`src/elf_plt.rs`), the analysis-pass unit tests (`s1_demangle`, `s1_protos`,
`s1_entry`, …), and the console e2e gates
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_w11_elf_plt_names.rs`,
`kuna-console/tests/verify_s1_entry.rs`).

The XML datatest corpus cannot exercise these: it embeds raw bytechunks with
explicit `<symbol>` definitions and never constructs an `ObjectLoadImage`, so the
ELF loader (and thus PLT resolution) is off that path. These fixtures drive the
real ELF parser.

| File | What | Exercises |
|---|---|---|
| `address_taken_stack_buffers_macho` | exact 50,080-byte Mach-O x86-64 witness from RE challenge `64c8b272b25df8732eebc2a6` (SHA-256 `979555f6b20fc5f024358ef26603f4c25e8db326941f86af30726eca9fea453e`) | JSON variable-use attribution for address-only stack arrays: `_main`'s 32-byte key buffer and 40-byte input buffer are passed to copy/input/compare calls but have no direct scalar Varnodes. Their `line_numbers` and instruction `addresses` must include those emitted uses, while unused frame slots stay empty. `tests/cli/address-taken-stack-buffers.json` pins the exact witness |
| `katavm_level1_x86_64` | exact unmodified `KataVM_L1` x86-64 ELF from challenge `605443e333c5d42c3d016f59` (28,682 bytes, SHA-256 `95c300aedc728b643bf97c39b5e8db88e9ddc40bf4cf337cd6c777929684a5f9`) | the unsigned-byte lowered-switch label witness at `0x12d0`: its selector is an `unsigned char`, and the unsigned range chain includes opcode `0x8b`. `loweredswitchlabels` must render `case 0x8b`, while explicit ablation restores the impossible `case -0x75`; `loweredswitch off` retains the original `v17 != 0x8b` chain. `tests/cli/unsigned-byte-vm-selector.json` and `tests/stages/ghdec-unsigned-byte-vm-selector.xml` pin the exact witness |
| `explicit_branch_assertion_pe_i386.exe` | exact unmodified 266,240-byte PE32/i386 witness from RE challenge `5ab77f5f33c5d40ad448c834` (`crkme.exe`, SHA-256 `9031b8200481747e7ddb5cd5fc2a74030cd04052770bfa23d857a0662a58bc06`) | explicit flow-override precedence at `0x40d126`: the machine instruction calls a return-address-discarding fragment, so `flow 0x40d126 branch` must follow its re-entry into the function rather than letting `tailcalljump` reinterpret the resulting branch as a call. `kuna-cli/tests/explicit_branch_assertion_cli.rs` pins the full-body and option-off controls, plus two near misses in `sub_401090` that must keep the `jmp 0x407b20` tail call at `0x401148`: a `branch` fact refused at that `jmp`, and one applied at the trampoline call `0x40109a` |
| `te_entrythumbflow_arm.te` | synthetic UEFI TE image (3.7 KB; generator `te_entrythumbflow_arm.py`, regenerate with `python3 te_entrythumbflow_arm.py`), machine `ARM` (`0x1c0`), `AddressOfEntryPoint` `0x1001` with the Thumb bit set, one `.text` holding a Thumb `movs r0,#7; bx lr` at `0x401000` followed by an A32 `bx lr` at `0x401004`; the same layout `loadimage_te::synthetic` builds in the crate tests | the entry-reachable Thumb context walk (`entrythumbflow`, default-on, DIV-153; `--option entrythumbflow off` restores the defect, where the Thumb entry decodes as A32). `tests/stages/kuna-entrythumbflow.xml` is the two-pass stage test; `kuna-console/tests/verify_te_image.rs` the e2e over the wider synthetic set |
| `armv4t_thumb_pe.exe` | project-authored ARMv4T Thumb PE32 image from `armv4t_thumb_pe.s` | PE machine `0x01c2` architecture recovery, odd Thumb entry normalization, container-derived `TMode=1`, explicit `--target` compatibility checks, and ARM/Thumb CLI override behavior |
| `armveneeralias_le32` | 1.7 KB ARM32 shared object built from `armveneeralias_le32.s` (`clang --target=armv7a-linux-gnueabihf -c` + `ld.lld -shared`, LLD 14.0.0, SHA-256 `5e1e6da0a68538079ea4caa6f222ace0b11555bdd5b1ebe65fdd1d128d9fe746`): the exported `answer` shares its address with the local ARM veneer name `__answer_from_arm`, which `.symtab` lists first, and a Thumb `caller` reaches `answer` through the PLT | ELF names that share an address: the loader keeps the later ones as aliases (`ObjectLoadImage::func_symbol_aliases`), so `answer` selects the veneer's body instead of its PLT stub while the reported name stays `__answer_from_arm`. `tests/stages/kuna-elfaliasnames.xml` is the stage test; `kuna-cli/tests/elf_symbol_aliases.rs` covers the synthetic linked/relocatable matrix built by `arm_aliases.rs` |
| `elfaliasclash_x86_64` | 16 KB dynamic x86-64 PIE built from `elfaliasclash_x86_64.c` + `elfaliasclash_b_x86_64.c` (`gcc -O1`, Ubuntu gcc 11.4.0, SHA-256 `3b99d2b6ec4ad89d8301c41ac0973eee8132ca6f748b10a55f0b361e9cf926a3`): `shared` is both a global alias of `twin` (same address) and a static function of its own | a same-address alias spelled like another function's own name never takes that name over: `shared` still selects the static function at `0x1155`. `tests/stages/kuna-elfaliasnames.xml` and `kuna-cli/tests/elf_symbol_aliases.rs` |
| `et_rel_status_arm.o` | project-authored ARM32 **ET_REL** object from `et_rel_status_arm.s` | architecture-specific `R_ARM_CALL`/data relocation application and return recovery when a status value is both returned on the normal path and passed to an explicit no-return call on a terminal guard-failure path; `status_caller` consumes the recovered result |
| `et_rel_status_aarch64.o` | project-authored AArch64 **ET_REL** object from `et_rel_status_aarch64.s` | `R_AARCH64_CALL26`, page/low-12 relocation application, and the same status-return/no-return-path recovery shape on the 64-bit ABI; `status_caller` consumes the recovered result |
| `entry_selectors_x86_64.o` | synthetic x86-64 **ET_REL** object produced from `entry_selectors_{a,b}_x86_64.s` | relocatable-object entry selection: two local `STT_FUNC` definitions share the name `duplicate_local` and raw offset zero but live in distinct `.text.selector_a` / `.text.selector_b` sections, so name and bare-offset selection must report both candidates while a section-qualified selector is exact |
| `fauxware` | classic non-PIE x86-64, not stripped (the angr `fauxware` sample) | `.plt` classic stubs (`FF 25` rip-rel), `.symtab` defined functions; `.eh_frame` FDE starts (`s1_entry`: 7 FDE starts incl. `_start`/`main`/`register_tm_clones`) |
| `cet_pie_x86_64` | PIE x86-64 with CET (`.plt.sec`) | `endbr64; FF 25` CET stubs, naming at the `.plt.sec` call target |
| `stripped_dynamic_x86_64` | PIE x86-64, `.symtab` stripped (only `.dynsym`) | PLT resolution with no `.symtab` (dynsym/rela.plt only); entry discovery (`s1_entry`): `e_entry`=0x1160, `DT_INIT`=0x1000, `DT_FINI`=0x1464, INIT/FINI_ARRAY ptrs, `_start`→`main` idiom → 0x1405, `.eh_frame` FDE starts — `sub_1405` (main) decompiles without `--addr` |
| `cpp_mangled_x86_64` | non-PIE x86-64 C++, not stripped | symbol demangling (`s1_demangle`): a defined `.symtab` C++ method `_ZN3foo3Bar3bazEi` must surface name-only as `foo::Bar::baz` |
| `msvc_rtti_x64.exe` / `msvc_rtti_x86.exe` | linked Windows PE (PE32+/x86-64 and PE32/x86), polymorphic C++ (`Shape` base + `Box` derived, virtual method), source `msvc_rtti.cpp` | MSVC RTTI / vftable class-name recovery (`s1_rtti`, `--option rtti on`): the `CompleteObjectLocator` → RTTI3/2/1 → RTTI0 graph in `.rdata`/`.data` recovers `Box`/`Shape` + labels `Box::vftable` / `<Class>::RTTI_Type_Descriptor` / `Box::RTTI_Complete_Object_Locator`. Exercises BOTH the x64 IBO32 image-base-relative ref path (name offset 16) and the x86 raw-VA path (name offset 8). VMAs pinned below |
| `pe_cookiecheck_x86_64.exe` | hand-assembled PE32+/x86-64 (1.5 KB; generator `pe_cookiecheck_x86_64.py`, regenerate with `python3 pe_cookiecheck_x86_64.py`) whose `main` carries the MSVC `/GS` prologue and epilogue: it stores `__security_cookie ^ rsp` in its frame, sets `EAX` to zero, and calls `__security_check_cookie` (`cmp rcx,[cookie]; rol rcx,0x10; test cx,0xffff; ret`, whose failure path tail-jumps into a `mov ecx,2; int 0x29` `__fastfail` stub). The CRT startup is `crtmain_x86_64.py`'s, so `entrymainproto` gives `main` its argc/argv/envp prototype and its `RET` has a return value to lose | The return-register narrowing (`calleeretpreserves`, default-on, DIV-133; `--option calleeretpreserves off` restores the defect, `return sub_140001080(v1);` for `sub_140001080(...); return 0;`). `tests/cli/main-returns-invented-cookie.json` is the CLI probe; the seam itself is pinned by `tests/stages/kuna-calleeretpreserves.xml` |
| `pe_double_score_return_x86_64.exe` | hand-assembled PE32+/x86-64 (3.5 KB; generator `pe_double_score_return_x86_64.py`) whose internal score function uses the authoritative `0x140003150`/`log@0x14000904f`/`cookie@0x140008140` VMAs, accumulates `log` in XMM6 through a loop and post-log volatile calls, divides it, copies it to XMM0, then calls a locked-void `/GS` checker. The cookie slot crosses the loop and the failure tail contains a nested call before `int 0x29` | Locked-void ABI-output preservation under `calleeretpreserves`, including the loop-carried exact-cookie proof; the generator also carries both an ordinary callee and an exact cookie-shaped callee that really clobber XMM0 as negative controls. `tests/cli/declaring-double-score-return.json` promotes the unchanged two-assert `a-cc4fdb4b53b3` acceptance onto this in-repo twin, and `tests/stages/kuna-declaring-double-score-return.xml` pins the stage seam |
| `pe_void_cookie_multi_exit_x86_64.exe` | faithful 16 KB PE32+/x86-64 witness from RE challenge `68b94ba38fac2855fe6fbada` (`crackme1.exe`, SHA-256 `16512154b0c419b2e4b064dbabd4932251ec5e0e11e14302d86821dca1ade1f0`). `sub_1400012f0` has three constant-result exits converging through a shared `/GS` cookie call; the saved cookie crosses a nested multi-phi loop SCC before the epilogue cancel | the exact locked-void `/GS` call-site proof across a nested phi SCC and preservation of the caller's EAX constants. `tests/cli/void-cookie-check-prototype.json` pins the faithful acceptance; `--option calleeretpreserves off` restores the undefined-EAX control |
| `pe_explicit_double_score_return_x86_64.exe` | refined variant of `pe_double_score_return_x86_64.exe` (3.5 KB; generator `pe_explicit_double_score_return_x86_64.py`) that round-trips XMM0's low dword through stack/XMM1 after the final double copy, forcing heritage to split the declared 8-byte return into two 4-byte cells without changing its value; it also exports `score` | Exact-cookie preservation of the adjacent `ContainsUnjustified` refinement cell, gated by the caller's locked declared output. `tests/cli/explicit-double-score-prototype.json` pins the three-prototype CLI path and `tests/stages/kuna-declaring-double-score-return.xml` carries locked-caller and option-off controls |
| `pe_chainedunwind_x86_64.exe`, `pe_chainedunwind_loop_x86_64.exe`, `pe_chainedunwind_plainft_x86_64.exe` | hand-assembled PE32+/x86-64 (2 KB each; generators `pe_chainedunwind*.py`, regenerate with `python3 <name>.py`) whose `.pdata` splits ONE logical function across two `RUNTIME_FUNCTION` records, the second carrying `UNWIND_INFO` with `UNW_FLAG_CHAININFO` | The chained-record entry skip (`pdatachained`, default-on, GH-403; `--option pdatachained off` restores the defect). The three differ only in what the primary's last instruction is, which is what decides the shape of the damage the bogus entry causes: a conditional branch (`} while ;`, invalid C), a loop latch (the decompile fails outright), and an ordinary fall-through (the second half of the function silently disappears). `kuna-console/tests/verify_pdatachained.rs` is the two-pass e2e over all three; `tests/cli/pe-chained-unwind-truncates-function.json` is the CLI probe. No Windows toolchain on this host, hence the byte-by-byte generators (same pattern as `crtmain_x86_64.py`) |
| `pe_rexthunk_x86_64.exe`, `pe_rexthunk_far_x86_64.exe`, `pe_rexthunk_reach_x86_64.exe` | hand-assembled PE32+/x86-64 (1.5 KB, 1.5 KB and 5.6 KB; generators `pe_rexthunk*.py`, regenerate with `python3 <name>.py`). `pe_rexthunk_x86_64.exe` has two imports, `KERNEL32.dll!InitializeSListHead` (IAT slot `0x140002050`) and `ExitProcess` (`0x140002058`): a wrapper at `0x140001030` that ends in the REX.W tail jump `48 ff 25` through the first slot (the MSVC `__scrt_initialize_type_info` shape), a bare `ff 25` linker thunk through the same slot at `0x140001040`, a function at `0x140001050` ending in `jmp qword ptr [rax+0x48]` (`48 ff 60 48`) directly followed by the bare `ExitProcess` thunk at `0x140001057`, and an entry calling all of them. `pe_rexthunk_far_x86_64.exe` is a contiguous three-thunk table at `0x140001020` whose IAT is at `0x180002060`, so each displacement's high byte is `40`, with no call to any thunk. `pe_rexthunk_reach_x86_64.exe` puts ten real thunks each directly after a function ending in `48 ff 60 48` and reaches each through one shape only: a `.rdata` or `.data` pointer, `mov rax, imm64; call rax`, a function table, a pointer inside `.text`, a `.pdata` record, an export, an `E9` stub, a pointer tail jump, or a short jump (`GetCurrentThreadId`, the one shape that is not counted); `0x140001170` and `0x140001150` end in a no-return call through an `imm64` and a `.text` pointer directly followed by another function | The REX-prefixed import-thunk rejection (`rexthunk`, default-on; `--option rexthunk off` restores the defect, an `InitializeSListHead` function at `0x140001038`, one byte into the wrapper's jump). The other thunks are the negatives: the `ExitProcess` thunk follows a `48` byte and keeps its name, and the call its no-return fact, because the entry calls it; the far table's `Sleep` and `ExitProcess` thunks follow a `40` byte and keep their names because the six bytes before each are the previous thunk; the reach fixture's thunks keep their names, and its two no-return calls stay `ExitProcess(0); // no-return` without absorbing the next function, because the image references each thunk. `kuna-console/tests/verify_rexthunk.rs` is the two-pass e2e; `tests/cli/pe-rex-tail-jump-phantom-thunk.json` is the CLI probe, and the two `pe-rex-tail-jump-option-off-*.json` probes check that `--option rexthunk off` reaches the loader from `decompile` and `decompile-all` |
| `pe_ordinal_i386.exe` | hand-assembled PE32/i386 (4.5 KB; generator `pe_ordinal_i386.py`) whose every import is by ordinal: `OLEAUT32.dll` #2 and #6 (IAT `0x401000`/`0x401004`), `WS2_32.dll` #23 and #115 (`0x401010`/`0x401014`), `MYLIB.dll` #7 (`0x401020`) and `OLEAUT32.dll` #9999 (`0x401028`); the entry at `0x401200` calls each slot through `call dword ptr [slot]` | PE import-by-ordinal naming (`peordinal`, default-on): the covered slots render `SysFreeString(SysAllocString(...))`, `socket(2,1,6)`, `WSAStartup(0x202,0)`, while `MYLIB_Ordinal_7` and `OLEAUT32_Ordinal_9999` keep the synthesized names; `--option peordinal off` restores `OLEAUT32_Ordinal_2` etc. `loader/kuna_peordinal.rs` has the unit test; `tests/cli/pe-ordinal-imports*.json` are the CLI probes |
| `pe_iatincode_readonly_i386.exe` | hand-assembled PE32/i386 (1 KB; generator `pe_iatincode_readonly_i386.py`) with two functions, import descriptors, INT, hint/name strings and three IAT slots all in one executable/read, non-writable section. The entry nests `GetModuleHandleA(0)` inside `VirtualAlloc(0x40, ...)`; the second function makes two distinguishable `GetDlgItemTextA` calls | external-reference identity outranks both `litpoolconst` and program-wide `readonly` folding. With `peimportcall off`, calls remain raw calls to their on-disk name RVAs; default/on and on+readonly preserve the exact nested named calls. `kuna-console/tests/verify_pe_import_readonly.rs` is the e2e and `tests/cli/pe-import-calls-become.json` is the promoted acceptance |
| `arraycoverwidth_x86_64` | project-authored non-PIE x86-64 ELF from `arraycoverwidth_x86_64.s` (`-nostdlib -Ttext=0x100000 -e vm`, 5 KB): two 16-byte stack banks zeroed with `movaps`, escaped to `sink` so nothing is dead, then swapped with the `movdqa/movdqa/movaps/movaps` quartet | the array-cover width render (`arraycoverwidth`, default-on; `--option arraycoverwidth off` restores the defect). It is the reduction of the crackmes.one `KataVM_L1` VM-interpreter witness whose sixteen-byte bank swap printed `v30[0] = v32[0];`, a one-byte lvalue for a sixteen-byte copy. `vm`@`0x100000`, `sink`@`0x100049`; the trailing `movzbl 0x3(%rsp)` is the genuine one-byte in-element read that must KEEP its `[3]` subscript. `tests/cli/16-byte-vm-state.json` is the CLI probe, `tests/stages/kuna-arraycoverwidth.xml` the two-pass stage test |
| `ptrarraydecl_x86_64` | project-authored x86-64 PIE ELF from `ptrarraydecl_x86_64.c` (`gcc -O2 -g -fno-stack-protector -fcf-protection=none -fno-inline`, 19 KB) whose DWARF types nest pointers with arrays: `get_row` returns `char (*)[16]`, `use_rows` keeps a `char (*)[16]` local and a `char (*[2])[16]` stack array, `get_names` returns `char *(*)[3]`, and `use_names` keeps the mirror `char *[2]` array of pointers | C declarator precedence in the declarations built around a name: the return type closes after the parameter list (`char (* get_row(int i))[16]`) and a local keeps its suffix after the name and array count (`char (*pair [2])[16];`). `use_names` is the negative control. `kuna-console/tests/verify_ptrarray_declarators.rs` is the end-to-end gate |
| `splitstorekeep_x86_64` | project-authored non-PIE x86-64 ELF from `splitstorekeep_x86_64.s` (`-nostdlib -no-pie -Wl,--build-id=none -Wl,-Ttext=0x100000 -e copy31`, 4.8 KB): `copy31`@`0x100000` copies 31 bytes of stack with four 8-byte moves at offsets 0, 8, 15 and 23, so the middle two overlap on byte 15; `copy32`@`0x100042` is the same shape at 32 bytes, where the four moves tile `[0,32)` and none of them overlaps; `sink`@`0x100084` | the refinement-split store mark (`splitstorekeep`, default-on, DIV-153; `--option splitstorekeep off` restores the defect, `copy31` emitting only the head store and the tail store with the fifteen bytes between them never written). It is the reduction of the crackmes.one `0xJam3z-Medium` witness whose `sub_15dc` copied a 31-byte password buffer and lost bytes 8..22. `copy32` is the control: refinement never fires on it, so its C is identical in both passes. `tests/cli/31-byte-buffer-copy.json` is the CLI probe, `tests/stages/kuna-splitstorekeep.xml` the two-pass stage test |
| `pe_subcommuteshift_x86_64.exe` | minimal PE32+ generated by `pe_subcommuteshift_x86_64.py`; its `.text` is the exact 9,024-byte `crackme_shroud.exe` `sub_1406fa160` bytechunk from `tests/stages/kuna-subcommuteshift.xml`, mapped at the original `0x1406fa160`, with virtual `.bss` covering `usage`@`0x1408f1c08` | the closure-grade `cancelling-byte-arithmetic-splits` acceptance. Default `cancelbytearithmetic` joins the complete `"Usage: %s <password>\n"` initializer; the option-off control pins the original computed middle byte plus its prefix and suffix copies. The generator consumes the stage bytes rather than carrying an independent transcription, so the two regression layers cannot drift. |
| `checker_stack_aggregate_x86_64` | project-authored non-PIE x86-64 ELF with DWARF from `checker_stack_aggregate_x86_64.c` (`cc -g -O0 -nostdlib -no-pie -fno-stack-protector -Wl,--build-id=none -Wl,-e,_start ...`, 11 KB): `stack_aggregate` writes the two 4-byte halves of one declared 8-byte local, passes its address to `sink`, then reads the low half | the P9 scalar-piece declaration fallback. The address expression creates a constant-only HighVariable with the symbol's full width; it must not masquerade as the whole storage sibling that will declare the local. Before the fix both real halves were suppressed and the body used undeclared `local`; `tests/cli/checker-uses-stack-aggregate.json` and `tests/stages/re-checker-stack-aggregate.xml` cover the reduced RE-friction witness |
| `constselectjump_x86_64` | project-authored non-PIE x86-64 ELF from `constselectjump_x86_64.s` (`-nostdlib -no-pie -Ttext=0x100000 -e csjmp`, 5 KB): `csjmp`@`0x100000` selects between two code addresses with `movabs`/`movabs`/`cmovz` and jumps through the register (`jmp *%r9`), the two arms at `0x100020` and `0x100030` returning `a1 + 1` and `a1 - 1` | the constant-select indirect-branch recovery (`constselectjump`, default off, carried by `--mode aggressive`; `--option constselectjump off` restores the defect, where the whole function is `(*v1)(); // jump-as-call` and neither arm is decoded). It is the reduction of the crackmes.one `5b52f6eb33c5d41c0b8ae55f` Mach-O `LOL` decoder at `0x10003c9e0`, whose entire nine-line body was the computed call over the two already-constant targets `0x10003ca26` / `0x10003cb26`. `tests/cli/conditional-indirect-branches-hide.json` is the CLI probe, `tests/stages/re-constselectjump.xml` the two-pass stage test |
| `segmentgap_i386` | hand-assembled i386 ELF (4.3 KB; generator `segmentgap_i386.py`, regenerate with `python3 segmentgap_i386.py`): one `R E` `PT_LOAD` `[0x8048000,0x8048014)` ending mid-page, an unmapped hole, then a `RW` `PT_LOAD` at `0x804a000` | the listing's end-of-mapped-memory clip (ungated -- a query, not a decode). It is the reduction of the crackmes.one `5ee1f28c33c5d449d91ae7c0` `keygenme` witness, whose `R E` segment stops at `0x80d1904`. Unfixed, `kuna disassemble 0x8048000 --addr --count 30` runs to `0x804803f` with twenty-two `ADD byte ptr [EAX],AL` rows read out of the loader's zero fill. The last mapped byte is a lone `0x00` on purpose: the `add [eax],al` the translator reads there STRADDLES the boundary and must list as `.byte`. `tests/cli/disassembly-fabricates-zero-byte.json` is the CLI probe, `kuna-cli/tests/disassemble_cli.rs` the e2e |

Every interesting function is a subprogram DEFINITION whose name is NOT on the definition DIE: `db::inner::scaled_add`@`0x401156` (namespace, `DW_AT_specification`), `Account::deposit`@`0x4011b2` (out-of-line member + artificial `this` typed by a `DW_TAG_class_type`), `Account::available`@`0x40120c` (`const` member -> `const Account *const`, the four-DIE qualifier chain that blew the type-mapper depth cap), `Account::bump`@`0x401232` (`const` member with a `DW_TAG_reference_type` parameter), `Account::make_id`@`0x401264` (`static` member, no artificial `this`). `maxof<int>`@`0x4014aa` / `maxof<double>`@`0x4014ca` DO carry their own `DW_AT_name`, but kuna files the demangled name as `maxof`, so only the ADDRESS-keyed prototype park reaches them. `probe_virtual_call`@`0x40127e` takes a `Shape *` (`void *` before the class arm) |

Fully stripped, so there is no DWARF and no `.symtab` — the exported `.dynsym` mangled names are the only signature source, which is the situation the feature exists for.

Hidden visibility is load-bearing: without it every implicit class method is emitted WEAK and *exported*, so `.dynsym` alone would name them and the recovery would have nothing to prove. Hidden **and** stripped, the only defined dynamic symbols are `probe_shapes` / `probe_widget` / `probe_generic`, so every class name, vtable and virtual method has to come from the `.rela.dyn` `__cxxabiv1` anchor or from nowhere. Covers all three typeinfo flavours — `shapes::Shape` (`__class_type_info`, no bases), `shapes::Circle` (`__si_class_type_info`), `shapes::Widget` (`__vmi_class_type_info`, `Loggable` at +0 and `Drawable` at +16, so the vtable object carries a SECOND sub-vtable of `this`-adjusting thunks with `offset-to-top = -16`) — plus the two naming hazards that silently cost recovery: `shapes::Vec<int>` / `shapes::Vec<double>` (distinct classes whose NAME-ONLY demangling collides) and `(anonymous namespace)::Hidden` (a TU-local type, whose ABI type-name string carries the leading `*` marker). `shapes::Shape::perimeter` is inherited unchanged by `Circle`, so it also pins the defining-base slot attribution |

Both are `#[inline(never)]`; a volatile-guarded `_start`@`0x2012b0` keeps them from being optimized away. `.comment` carries the `rustc version` record, so `option rustabi auto` fires here without `always`.

Nothing at the call site separates the two, so the seam decodes the callee (`probe_callee_return_writes`) and refuses the pair; the function must render identically with the option off and on. Hand-written asm because no compiler emits a read of a caller-saved register the callee never sets. The same two functions are the second `<bytechunk>` in `tests/stages/kuna-rustabi.xml` |

A union member selects itself by OFFSET and the discriminant is never consulted, so a variant name is sound only where exactly one variant claims the bytes. `r16`@`0x201220` and `use16`@`0x201240` are a `Result<u64,u64>` producer/consumer pair (size 16, tag u64 @0, `Ok` discr 0 and `Err` discr 1 BOTH with `__0` at 8) — the case where it is NOT sound, and this binary rendered `Ok` ten times and `Err` never before the suppression; `put_res`@`0x201260` writes the same payload through a pointer so the store is a field path (`(dst->payload).field_0x8.__0`, no variant named); `put_opt`@`0x201280` does the same for an `Option<u64>`, whose only payload-carrying variant is `Some`, so `(dst->payload).Some.__0` is FORCED and must survive. `_start`@`0x2012a0`.

| `cortexm_aifstrict_le32` | hand-assembled, **stripped** bare-metal ARM Cortex-M ELF32 (581 bytes; generator `cortexm_aifstrict_le32.py`, regenerate with `python3 cortexm_aifstrict_le32.py`) | **The AIF gap-cursor aligned slide** (`aif::kuna_aifstrict`, `--option aifstrict off` restores the defect; default-on, GH-299). Same vector-table and 20-helper scaffolding as `cortexm_poolentry_le32` above — the *shipped*-signature vector shape, so nothing depends on `cortexmvectors`, and twenty `movs r0,#k ; movs r1,#k ; movs r2,#k ; bx lr` helpers at `0x080000a0` that clear both of AIF's floors. Two shapes: **THE DEFECT** (`A`@`0x08000140` loads `POOL1`@`0x08000148` = `0x20001000`; the byte-granular cursor rejects `POOL1`, slides one byte, and accepts `0x0800014a`, where the pool word's HIGH halfword `0x2000` decodes as `movs r0,#0` and completes the helpers' fingerprint — and because an accept advances the cursor past the accepted body, the real `B`@`0x0800014c` is never probed, so the phantom REPLACES it; with the option on, `0x0800014a` is 2-mod-4 and not a hole start, the slide goes straight to `B`, and `B` is recovered); and **THE CONTROL** (`C`/`POOL2`@`0x0800015c`/`D`@`0x08000160`, identical except `D` opens `movs ; adds`, a fingerprint nothing shares, so the *aligned* probe at the pool end is REJECTED in both passes — the option declines to probe addresses that cannot be instruction boundaries, it never lowers the acceptance bar). `kuna-console/tests/verify_aifstrict.rs` is the two-pass e2e over both, plus an `aif off` inertness pin. No cross toolchain on this host emits a bare-metal STM32 link layout, hence the byte-by-byte generator |
| `cortexm_aifcorroborate_le32` | hand-assembled, **stripped** bare-metal ARM Cortex-M ELF32 (1,165 bytes; generator `cortexm_aifcorroborate_le32.py`, regenerate with `python3 cortexm_aifcorroborate_le32.py`) | **The AIF accept corroboration test** (`aif::kuna_aifcorroborate`, `--option aifcorroborate on`; default-off, in no preset, GH-313). Same *shipped*-signature vector table as the fixtures above, so nothing depends on `cortexmvectors`, but the fingerprint histogram is stocked with **two** counts on purpose: twenty `movs r0,#k ; movs r1,#k ; movs r2,#k ; bx lr` helpers at `0x08000160` give `movs ; movs` a count of 20 (past AIF's floor of 4, below the corroboration threshold of 50) and fifty `movs r0,#k ; adds r1,#k ; adds r2,#k ; bx lr` helpers at `0x08000200` give `movs ; adds` a count of exactly 50; the reset vector `BL`s all seventy so the walk discovers them. Three shapes follow in the trailing undefined gap, one per branch of `startCount >= 50 || corroborated`: **THE DEFECT** (`U`@`0x08000390` opens `movs ; movs` (20), calls nothing, jumps nowhere and only reaches `bx lr` — upstream's `AggressiveInstructionFinderAnalyzer.java:367` refuses exactly this and kuna never ported it, so it is accepted by default and refused with the option on); **THE CORROBORATED CONTROL** (`V`@`0x0800039c`, the SAME count-20 prologue but its third instruction is a `bl` into the discovered `H1`, so upstream's "calls always add info" keeps it in BOTH passes — same count, opposite verdict, which is what proves the option tests corroboration rather than raising the count floor); and **THE COUNT CONTROL** (`W`@`0x080003a8`, as uncorroborated as `U` but opening the count-50 fingerprint, so `50 >= 50` keeps it in both passes). `U`'s own interior at `0x08000392` is deliberately a count-50 `movs ; adds` prologue that still reaches the same `bx lr`: it would be accepted on the count branch if refusing `U` released the gap cursor into `U`'s body, so its absence in both passes pins the reject-claims-its-body pairing (dropping that pairing turns a 361-entry mid-body cut into a 222-entry mid-body RISE on the 3.4 MB PE witness). `kuna-console/tests/verify_aifcorroborate.rs` is the two-pass e2e over all three shapes plus the cursor pairing and an `aif off` inertness pin. No cross toolchain on this host emits a bare-metal STM32 link layout, hence the byte-by-byte generator |
| `cortexm_poolentry_le32` | hand-assembled, **stripped** bare-metal ARM Cortex-M ELF32 (601 bytes; generator `cortexm_poolentry_le32.py`, regenerate with `python3 cortexm_poolentry_le32.py`) | **ARM literal-pool inference** (`aif::kuna_poolentry`, `--option poolentry on`, default-off). Its vector table is the *shipped*-signature shape (`.text`@`0x08000000` is `AX`, `word[0]` = `0x20001000`, `word[1]` = `e_entry` = `0x08000041`), so nothing here depends on `cortexmvectors`. Twenty `movs r0,#k ; movs r1,#k ; movs r2,#k ; bx lr` helpers at `0x080000a0`, all `BL`-reached from the reset vector, clear AIF's two floors at once — `MINIMUM_FUNCTION_COUNT` (20) and `FINGERPRINT_THRESHOLD` (4 functions sharing the `movs ; movs` / 4-byte prologue fingerprint). Three shapes follow: **PHANTOM** (`A`@`0x08000140` loads `POOL1`@`0x08000148` = `0x20001000`, whose HIGH halfword `0x2000` decodes as a dead `movs r0,#0`, so AIF accepts `0x0800014a` and jumps past `B`@`0x0800014c`, which is never probed — with the option on the entry MOVES from `sub_800014a` to `sub_800014c`); **UNPAIRED** (`C`/`POOL2`@`0x0800015c`/`D`@`0x08000160`, identical except `D` opens `movs ; adds`, a fingerprint nothing shares, so no replacement entry exists and the `sub_800015e` phantom must be KEPT — the pairing invariant that takes corpus bodies-destroyed from 531 to 0); and **SPLIT** (`G`@`0x08000168`'s literal resolves onto `F`@`0x08000170`'s own first word, which the Listing never decoded, so the entry moves 4 bytes in to `sub_8000174` and loses `movs r0,#7 ; movs r1,#8` — the single disclosed residue of the corpus measurement, pinned as current behaviour). `kuna-console/tests/verify_poolentry.rs` is the two-pass e2e over all three, plus an `aif off` inertness pin. No cross toolchain on this host emits a bare-metal STM32 link layout, hence the byte-by-byte generator |
| `cortexm_tailcall_le32` | hand-assembled, **stripped** bare-metal ARM Cortex-M ELF32 (437 bytes; generator `cortexm_tailcall_le32.py`, regenerate with `python3 cortexm_tailcall_le32.py`) | **tail-call function entries** (`listing::kuna_tailcallentry`, `--option tailcallentry on`, default-off). Its vector table is the *shipped*-signature shape (`.isr_vector`@`0x08000000` is `AX` in a `PF_X` load, `word[0]` = `0x20008000`, `word[1]` = `e_entry` = `0x08008001`), so nothing here depends on `cortexmvectors`. `.text`@`0x08008000` holds one genuine tail call plus the three near-miss shapes the containment model must keep rejecting — every one of the four is reached ONLY by an unconditional `B`, so the naive rule takes all four. `TAIL`@`0x08008020` (`movs r0,#0x2a ; bx lr`) is branched to from `_start`@`0x08008000` across the discovered entry `helper`@`0x08008010`, so it crosses a function boundary and is **accepted**; `.Lbody`@`0x08008038` stays inside `loopfn`@`0x08008030`'s own entry-ordered region (the rotated-loop-head case) and is rejected; `EPI`@`0x08008058` opens `pop {r4,pc}` (a shared epilogue) and is rejected; `SPIN`@`0x08008060` (`movs r0,#0 ; b .`) never terminates and is rejected. `kuna-console/tests/verify_tailcallentry.rs` is the two-pass e2e: default registers five functions and emits `TAIL`'s body inside `sub_8008000`; with the option on `sub_8008020` registers and decompiles to `return 0x2a;` while the other three stay undiscovered. No cross toolchain on this host emits a bare-metal STM32 link layout, hence the byte-by-byte generator |
| `function_boundary_return_x86_64` | hand-written ELF64 assembly (source `function_boundary_return_x86_64.s`; rebuild with `as` + `ld` commands in the source header) | **shared return at a real function boundary.** `shared_wrapper` reaches the one-byte STT_FUNC `callable_ret` only by fall-through, while `ret_caller` calls that same RET directly, proving the entry is genuine and must remain inventoried. `after_ret` makes flow beyond the admitted RET visible. `ordinary_first` falls into an ordinary MOV entry and is the hard-bound control: default must not absorb `ordinary_next` (11 vs 22 with `funcboundflow off`). The direct- and computed-branch entry pairs prove that instruction-terminal branches are still bounded because following them can consume more code. |
| `entry_ret_dispatch_i386` | project-authored static i386 ELF from `entry_ret_dispatch_i386.s` (`gcc -m32 -nostdlib -no-pie -Wl,-e,entry_dispatch`, 9 KB), whose ELF entry is `entry_dispatch`@`0x8049000` | `entryretdispatch` (default-on, DIV-168). `entry_dispatch` is three `push <continuation>; push [slot]; ret` links, reduced from the bm3 entry stub; default must recover all three calls and both later continuations, while option off restores the first RET. `ordinary_ret`, `immediate_ret`, `incoming_return_ret`, `computed_ret`, and `constant_ret` preserve ordinary RET, RET-immediate, copied incoming-return-address, slot-computed RET, and unrelated constant-target RET semantics. `adjusted_fallthrough_ret` discards an exact fall-through push and `unrelated_fallthrough_store_ret` writes it to unrelated memory. `negative_displacement_ret` overwrites the continuation through `[eax-4]` and would execute the helper twice, `conditional_bypass_ret` has a path reaching RET without setup, and `partial_sp_ret` destroys the ESP relation through a partial SP write; all remain returns. `kuna-cli/tests/entry_ret_dispatch_cli.rs` covers both option arms and explicit RETURN precedence; `tests/stages/kuna-entryretdispatch.xml` is the two-pass stage case; `tests/cli/entry-point-ret-dispatch.json` is the promoted acceptance. |
| `funcstart_patterns_x86_64` | **stripped**, statically-linked **x86-64** ELF, `gcc -O2 -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fcf-protection=none -no-pie -fno-pic -fno-stack-protector` (source `funcstart_patterns_x86_64.c`) | the **full byte-pattern function-start** pass (`s1_entry::FuncStartPatternPass`, `--option funcstart_patterns on`, default-off): a `static` helper `widget`@**`0x401130`** has the prologue `push rbx; mov rbx,rdi` (`53 48 89 fb`) preceded by an 8-byte NOP pad (`0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00`). That is the FULL upstream `<patternpairs>` postpattern `0x534889fb` (PUSH RBX; MOV RBX,RDI) gated by the NOP prepattern `0x0f1f840000000000` — but it is **not** one of the three bare x86-64 prologues the always-on minimal oracle (`entry_disc` oracle 5) ports, and `widget` carries **no symbol** (stripped, `static`), **no `.eh_frame` FDE** (`-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables`), and is not `e_entry`/INIT/FINI/`main`. So `widget` is discoverable **only** via the full pattern set: `kuna-console/tests/verify_funcstart_patterns.rs` asserts `sub_401130` is found + decompilable with `--option funcstart_patterns on` and **NOT** registered by default. The other helper `ext`@`0x401170` is `T`/global (stripped). Pinned VMAs read from the un-stripped build's `nm` (`widget`=`0x401130`, `ext`=`0x401170`, `main`=`0x401020`). |
| `aif_gap_x86_64` | **STRIPPED** dynamic PIE x86-64 (`-O0`), no unwind tables (source `aif_gap_x86_64.c`) | Aggressive Instruction Finder gap-walk (`s1_aif`, the third Listing/xref consumer; the kuna analog of Ghidra's `AggressiveInstructionFinderAnalyzer`, **gated off** by default). 24 handlers `h0..h23` are called DIRECTLY from `main` (`sub_13c9`, recovered via the PIE `_start`→`main` `lea rdi,[rip+main]` idiom), so the recursive-descent Listing walk reaches them — clearing Ghidra's `MINIMUM_FUNCTION_COUNT` (20, here `function_count`=33) — and their identical `push rbp; mov rsp,rbp; mov edi,-0x14(rbp); …` prologue stocks the function-start fingerprint histogram (one bucket shared by 25 functions, ≥ the acceptance threshold 4). `hidden_handler`@`0x13ae` is the gap target: it is in **no** symbol table (stripped), has **no** `.eh_frame` FDE (built `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables`), and is **never** the target of a static CALL — its address lives ONLY in the const `.rodata` function-pointer `table`@`0x3df0` (slot 1=`0x3df8`, an `R_X86_64_RELATIVE` reloc → `0x13ae`), which `main` indexes with a `volatile` (unfoldable) value and calls via `call *reg`. So entry-disc + funcsyms + the static walk all miss it (`main` renders the call as `(**(code **)(…0x3df0))(…)`, unresolved). With `--option listing on --option aif on`, AIF's gap-walk fingerprint-matches `hidden_handler`'s prologue + valid-subroutine-checks it (a clean `ret`, 11 instructions) and emits it as a discovered entry → `sub_13ae`, decompilable by name. Default (off) leaves it undiscovered (byte-identical parity). Drives `kuna-console/tests/verify_aif.rs` |
| `alignednew_x86_64` | tiny non-PIE x86-64 ET_EXEC built `-nostdlib -static` from hand-written asm (source `alignednew_x86_64.s`), not stripped | the **forward** direction of call-site argument reconciliation (`option calleearityfwd`, DIV-103, P4; e2e `kuna-cli/tests/decompile_cli.rs`, stage `tests/stages/kuna-calleearityfwd.xml`, promoted probe `tests/cli/argument-recovery-knobs-still.json`). MSVC's aligned `operator new` shape on SysV: `caller`@`0x401010` calls `callee`@`0x401000` from BOTH arms of `cmp $0x1000,%rdi`. The large arm writes a fresh `rdi` (`lea 0x27(%rdi),%rax; cmp %rdi,%rax; jbe bail; mov %rax,%rdi; call`) and keeps its argument; the small arm passes `rdi` live-in (`test %rdi,%rdi; jz zero; call`), so `Funcdata::only_op_use` rejects the trial on the guard's `CPUI_CBRANCH` and the argument is dropped. The small arm is laid out SECOND and reached by a forward branch, which is what puts its call spec FIRST in `qlst` order: `calleearity` (which reconciles only against an already-final sibling) has no witness yet and declines, and only the end-of-pass retry rescues it. Default renders `callee(a0)` / `callee(a0 + 0x27)`; `--option calleearityfwd off` and `--option calleearity off` both restore `callee();`. Hand-written asm because no compiler emits this shape without a libc allocator behind it |
| `covercopy_x86_64` | non-PIE x86-64, `gcc -O0 -no-pie -fno-pic -fno-stack-protector`, not stripped (source `covercopy_x86_64.c`) | the two **P6 Cover-extension miscompilations** (`kuna-console/tests/verify_cover_miscompile.rs`, DIV-47). `lookup_service` has three `return name;` guards sharing one `-O0` epilogue with a `lookup()` call clobbering the return register in between — pins that the reload `vN = a0;` on the lookup-failed path is emitted (`Merge::checkCopyPair`'s dominance range needs `addRefPoint`, `merge.cc:1121`; without it the emitted C returns NULL where the binary returns the parameter). `two_selects` has two `cond ? g_step : 0` phis both inlined into one `emit(...)` argument — pins that they stay two variables (`Merge::markImplied` must dirty its operands' Covers, `merge.cc:1595-1605`, and a Varnode `coverdirty` must reach its HighVariable, `varnode.cc:377-378`; without it the argument subtracts the second select twice). Both assertions are on the VALUE-carrying statement, not a line count |
| `hostile_size_low32_x86_64` / `hostile_size_neg_x86_64` / `hostile_size_sane_x86_64` | three byte-identical non-PIE x86-64 programs (`gcc -no-pie -nostdlib -e main`, sources beside them) differing ONLY in the `st_size` of the data symbol `g_a`@`0x402000`: `0x100000000`, `0xfffffff0`, and `8` | the **symbol-extent clamp** (GH-339, `kuna-console/tests/verify_hostile_symbol_sizes.rs`). `st_size` is a 64-bit ELF field no header check validates, and arm 4a of `commit_analysis_output` narrows it to the type factory's `int4`. Narrowing BEFORE the clamp let two classes through: low-32-zero truncated to a size-0 type, which `add_symbol_internal` rejects — and because the commit applies its arms in place with `?`, that one symbol aborted the WHOLE commit (`kuna functions` exited 1 with nothing, and the stash is `mem::take`n so a retry commits nothing); sign-bit-set truncated to a NEGATIVE size that indexed the type factory's caches out of bounds and aborted the PROCESS (exit 101). All three fixtures must now load with `g_a` named. The sizes come from the assembler (`.size g_a, …`) — nothing is byte-patched after the link, so they rebuild reproducibly. Neither parity corpus can cover this: both are symbol-less bytechunks that never construct an `ObjectLoadImage` |
| `switchtable_i386` / `switchtable_x86_64` | two tiny non-PIE ELF `dispatch` routines built `gcc -nostdlib -no-pie -Wl,-Ttext=0x100000 -e dispatch` from hand-written asm (sources `switchtable_i386.s` / `switchtable_x86_64.s`), 9 KB each | **jump-table following** in the on-demand xref walk (`listing/kuna_switchtable.rs`; e2e `kuna-console/tests/verify_switchtable.rs`, CLI probe `tests/cli/string-ownership-misses-literal.json`). Each is the reduction of crackmes.one/60be2ad433c5d410b8842c95, whose window procedure dispatches `JMP dword ptr [EAX*0x4 + 0x4017c4]` and whose case bodies — and the literals they push — were invisible to `kuna xrefs` / `kuna strings`. Four cases push a distinct literal and the default arm pushes a fifth; the default arm is reached by the `JA`, so it was always attributed and is the control. The two differ in table stride (`.long` / `.quad`) and in how the literal is materialized (`PUSH imm32` / RIP-relative `LEA`). VMAs pinned in the e2e: `dispatch`@`0x100000` and the table@`0x101000` in both; the dispatch is `0x100009` (i386) / `0x100007` (x86-64) |
| `overlaplocals_i386` | project-authored static i386 ELF assembled from `overlaplocals_i386.s` (`as --32`, then `ld -m elf_i386 --build-id=none`), with `overlap_bytes` copying three ten-byte literals through EAX/AX/AL/AH into escaped stack buffers inside a loop | the receive-side invariant for overlapping subregister locals: each two-byte owner is declared once and both byte-piece references bind to that whole object under default, Ghidra naming, `dedupvardecls off`, and whole-binary JSON output. The fixture is independently authored under this repository's Apache-2.0 license and contains no dataset bytes. The promoted cases are `tests/cli/overlapping-subregister-temporaries-receive.json` and its `overlapping-subregister-locals-{ghidra,dedup-off,whole-binary-json}.json` siblings |
| `switchtable_pic_x86_64` (ELF, 9 KB, source `switchtable_pic_x86_64.s`, same `gcc -nostdlib -no-pie -Wl,-Ttext=0x100000 -e dispatch` recipe) / `pe_switchdelta_x86_64.exe` (PE32+, 3 KB, generator `pe_switchdelta_x86_64.py`, regenerate with `python3 pe_switchdelta_x86_64.py`) | the **delta-encoded** jump table (GH-456, same module and e2e as the pair above; CLI probe `tests/cli/xrefs-callees-not-complete.json`). Neither half of the shipped rule holds on these: the table base is materialized by an instruction of its own — so the dispatch names no address at all — and the entries are signed 32-bit displacements rather than pointers. The ELF is the gcc form (`lea jt(%rip),%rdx; movslq (%rdx,%rax,4),%rax; add %rdx,%rax; jmp *%rax`, base == table) with four cases each `LEA`ing a distinct literal; the PE is the MSVC form (`LEA RDX,[__ImageBase]; MOV ECX,[RDX + RBX*0x4 + 0x2000]; ADD RCX,RDX; JMP RCX`, base != table) whose four case bodies each hold a direct `CALL` nothing else in the image reaches, which is the reporter's missing-callee symptom. `.pdata` gives the PE's functions RUNTIME_FUNCTIONs so the inventory finds them without symbols. VMAs pinned in the e2e: `dispatch`@`0x100000` / `0x140001040`, the branch at `0x100015` / `0x14000105d`, the table at `0x101000` / `0x140002000`. No Windows toolchain on this host, hence the byte-by-byte PE generator |
| `picpool_arm_le32` | 1,297-byte A32 ARM ELF assembled byte by byte by `picpool_arm_le32.py` (no ARM cross toolchain on this host), mapped entirely under 0x1000 | **PIC pool composition** in the on-demand xref walk (`listing/kuna_picpool.rs`; e2e `kuna-console/tests/verify_picpool.rs`, CLI probe `tests/cli/arm-pic-literal-pool.json`). The reduction of crackmes.one/68d40081224c0ec5dcedc2d2, whose `main` forms every string address as `ldr rX,[pool] ; add rX,pc,rX` — the pool word is a signed displacement, not a pointer, so following it as one declines and the literals were referenced by nothing. `uses_prompt`@`0x420` is the adjacent pair and `scheduled`@`0x430` the same pair with two instructions in between; `no_pc`@`0x448` is the control, `add r0,r0,#4` on a word whose sum IS a mapped literal. The low mapping is load-bearing: it holds the `checkOperands` 4096 floor off the composed address, as the witness does |
| `retpushedhalf_x86_64` | 4.8 KB static ELF assembled from `retpushedhalf_x86_64.s` (`as && ld`), holding `xordec` -- the WeeperVM four-argument decryptor reduced to its prologue/epilogue, with an alignment `push %r8` popped into `RDX` -- and the control `regmove`, whose `RDX = R8` is an ordinary `mov` | the push-only placement rejection (`retpushedhalf`, default-on, DIV-156; `--option retpushedhalf off` restores the defect, where `xordec` grows a fifth argument and a 128-bit return). `tests/stages/kuna-retpushedhalf.xml` is the two-pass stage test; `tests/cli/alignment-push-pop-invents.json` the promoted RE-friction probe |
| `raw_compat_int80_x86_64` | deterministic 17-byte headerless x86-64 image generated by `raw_compat_int80_x86_64.py`: `ENDBR64; MOV EAX,1; MOV EBX,0; INT 0x80; RET`, mapped at `0x1000` by the CLI probe | Linux's i386 compatibility entry from long mode (`linuxsyscall`): syscall 1 must render as standalone `sys_exit(0);`, never native x86-64 `write` or a generic `syscall()`. `tests/cli/linux-compatibility-int-0x80.json` is the promoted probe; `tests/stages/kuna-linuxsyscall-x64-compat.xml` adds a native `SYSCALL` control |

Provenance: `fauxware`, `cet_pie_x86_64`, `stripped_dynamic_x86_64` copied
verbatim from `bs-artifacts/binaries/` (`fauxware`, `debug_symbol`,
`debug_symbol_mod_stripped` respectively). `cpp_mangled_x86_64` was built locally
with `g++ -O0 -no-pie -fno-pic` from a tiny `namespace foo { struct Bar { void
baz(int); }; } void foo::Bar::baz(int){...} int main(){...}` source.
`entry_selectors_x86_64.o` is project-authored synthetic assembly under the
repository's Apache-2.0 license. It is reproducible with
`as --64 -o entry_selectors_a_x86_64.o entry_selectors_a_x86_64.s`, the matching
command for `entry_selectors_b_x86_64.s`, then
`ld -r -o entry_selectors_x86_64.o entry_selectors_a_x86_64.o
entry_selectors_b_x86_64.o`; the two intermediate objects are not retained.
`et_rel_status_arm.o` and `et_rel_status_aarch64.o` are project-authored
synthetic assembly under the repository's Apache-2.0 license. Regenerate them
with `arm-linux-gnueabi-as -o et_rel_status_arm.o et_rel_status_arm.s` and
`aarch64-linux-gnu-as -o et_rel_status_aarch64.o et_rel_status_aarch64.s`.
These two committed objects provide the end-to-end ARM/AArch64 status-return
proof. In-memory relocation and layout tests cover the complete supported
ARM/AArch64/PowerPC64 and generic-width matrix, REL/RELA addends, both byte
orders, local and external targets, interworking, bounds/range/alignment errors,
missing TOCs, malformed encodings, and bounded diagnostic aggregation; no
proprietary object is part of the regression suite.
`armv4t_thumb_pe.exe` is project-authored synthetic assembly under the same
license. Regenerate it with `clang --target=thumbv4t-windows-msvc -c
armv4t_thumb_pe.s -o armv4t_thumb_pe.obj`, then `lld-link /machine:arm
/entry:entry /subsystem:native /nodefaultlib /timestamp:0
/out:armv4t_thumb_pe.exe armv4t_thumb_pe.obj`, and finally change the PE COFF
Machine field from ARMNT (`0x01c4`) to THUMB (`0x01c2`); the intermediate object
is not retained. The four instruction bytes are independently authored and the
fixture contains no vendor input.
The ARM input-context CLI regressions also generate small ELF and THUMB COFF
images in memory from project-authored instruction bytes using `object::write`
(`kuna-cli/tests/common/arm_images.rs`, same Apache-2.0 license). Their mapping
symbols deliberately exercise conflicting and mixed ARM/Thumb metadata;
generated files are scratch artifacts and are not repository fixtures.
`cpp_noreturn_x86_64`: `g++ -O0 -no-pie -fno-pic -o cpp_noreturn_x86_64
cpp_noreturn_x86_64.cpp` (source vendored alongside) — a `fail()` that tail-calls
`std::terminate()` plus a `throw` (→ `__cxa_throw`); both are mangled no-return
`.dynsym` imports the demangle pass renames, so they verify the address-resolved
no-return commit. `cppproto_x86_64` (24408 bytes, source vendored alongside as
`cppproto_x86_64.cpp`): `g++ -O0 -g -no-pie -fno-pic -o cppproto_x86_64
cppproto_x86_64.cpp`. `-O0` keeps every member function out of line (so each
definition DIE really does carry only `DW_AT_specification`), `-g` keeps
`.debug_info`, and `-no-pie` fixes the VMAs pinned above.
`cppsig_x86_64.so` (source vendored alongside as `cppsig_x86_64.cpp`): `g++ -O0
-shared -fPIC -fno-inline -o cppsig_x86_64.so cppsig_x86_64.cpp` then `strip
--strip-all cppsig_x86_64.so`. A SHARED library so the mangled names survive in
`.dynsym`, `--strip-all` so nothing else does, and `-fno-inline` so every body
stays reachable and distinct. `sig::combine` deliberately calls no member
function: an intra-library call to an exported member emits a PLT stub carrying
the same mangled name, and `load function <name>` would then resolve to the stub.
`itaniumrtti_x86_64.so` (source vendored alongside as `itaniumrtti_x86_64.cpp`):
`g++ -O0 -g0 -fPIC -shared -fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden -o
itaniumrtti_x86_64.so itaniumrtti_x86_64.cpp` then `strip --strip-all
itaniumrtti_x86_64.so`. A SHARED library so `.rela.dyn` keeps the undefined
`_ZTVN10__cxxabiv1*_type_infoE` relocations that anchor the whole recovery,
`-fvisibility=hidden` so no class method leaks into `.dynsym` (the two `probe_*`
entry points carry an explicit `visibility("default")` attribute), and
`--strip-all` so nothing else survives. Addresses are NOT pinned: the tests
assert on recovered NAMES, which is what the feature produces.

`rdtsc_zero_extend_x86_64` (4664 bytes, source vendored alongside as
`rdtsc_zero_extend_x86_64.s`): `as -o rdtsc_zero_extend_x86_64.o
rdtsc_zero_extend_x86_64.s && ld -o rdtsc_zero_extend_x86_64
rdtsc_zero_extend_x86_64.o`. The one function seeds nonzero upper halves in
RAX/RDX, executes `RDTSC`, and recombines EDX:EAX, so correct x86-64 lifting
reduces its return value to exactly `rdtsc()`.

`eh_lsda_x86_64` (14744 bytes, source vendored alongside as
`eh_lsda_x86_64.cpp`): `g++ -O1 -no-pie -fno-pic -fexceptions -o eh_lsda_x86_64
eh_lsda_x86_64.cpp` then `strip eh_lsda_x86_64` (drops `.symtab`; keeps
`.eh_frame` + `.gcc_except_table`). The source is a `guarded()` with a
`try { may_throw(x); } catch (const std::runtime_error&) {...} catch (int) {...}`
over an out-of-line throwing helper — `-fexceptions` (default for C++) emits the
`zPLR`-augmented FDEs whose `L` char points each FDE at an LSDA in
`.gcc_except_table`, and the `catch` blocks become the landing pads. `-no-pie`
keeps the landing-pad VMAs fixed/deterministic for the pinned test consts; `-O1`
keeps it small (14 KB) while still emitting all four landing pads. The landing
pads (`0x4012bf`/`0x4012e2`/`0x401352`/`0x401366`) were decoded by hand from the
`.gcc_except_table` call-site tables and cross-checked against `objdump -d`
(every one is an `endbr64`) and `readelf --debug-dump=frames` (the FDE LSDA
augmentation-data pointers `8c 21 40 00`=`0x40218c`, `98 21 40 00`=`0x402198`).
**Pin the landing-pad VMAs as test consts.** `dwarf_stripped_x86_64`: `cc -g -O0 -no-pie -fno-pic t.c -o x` then
`objcopy --wildcard --strip-symbol='*' x dwarf_stripped_x86_64` (empties the symbol
table, keeps `.debug_*` — so DWARF is the sole name source; `t.c` = three funcs
`add_values`/`compute`/`main`). `switchtab_x86_64`: `gcc -O1 -no-pie -fno-pic s.c`
with a `switch(argc){case 0..7}`. `rust_hello_x86_64`: built with rustc 1.90.0
(`1159e78c4 2025-09-14`, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) as a freestanding `#![no_std]`
`#![no_main]` binary —
`rustc -C panic=abort -C opt-level=1 -C codegen-units=1 --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -C link-args=-nostartfiles tiny.rs -o rust_hello_x86_64`
where `tiny.rs` defines a `#[panic_handler]`, a `#[no_mangle] black_box`, a
`mod m { #[inline(never)] pub fn rusty_helper(x:u64)->u64 {…} }`, and a
`#[no_mangle] _start`. The `#![no_std]` form keeps it tiny (2576 bytes, kept
**un**stripped so the Rust-mangled symbol survives) while still emitting the
`rustc version` `.comment` record and a `_ZN…17h<hex>E` symbol.

`rust_scalarpair_x86_64` (2088 bytes, source vendored alongside as
`rust_scalarpair_x86_64.rs`): built with the same rustc 1.90.0 as
`rust_hello_x86_64` —
`rustc -C opt-level=2 -C panic=abort -C relocation-model=static -C link-args=-nostartfiles --edition 2021 rust_scalarpair_x86_64.rs -o rust_scalarpair_x86_64`.
`-C relocation-model=static` is load-bearing twice: it makes `cons`'s call to
`prod` a **direct** `e8 rel32` (a PIE cdylib routes it through the GOT, which no
`<bytechunk>` can reproduce) and it fixes the VMAs, so the stage testcase can
embed the bytes at their real addresses. `_start` reads a `static mut` through
`read_volatile` and stores the result through `write_volatile`, which is the
cheapest way to stop `-C opt-level=2` from constant-folding the whole program
away — without it the linker emits a two-byte `jmp .` and nothing else.

`rust_clobber_pair_x86_64` (1800 bytes, source vendored alongside as
`rust_clobber_pair_x86_64.rs`): same rustc 1.90.0 and the same
`-C relocation-model=static` reason as `rust_scalarpair_x86_64` — a direct
`e8 rel32` call and fixed VMAs, so the stage testcase can embed the bytes. Both
functions are `global_asm!` with explicit `.type`/`.size` directives, without
which the linker emits them as zero-sized `NOTYPE` symbols and kuna does not see
them as functions at all.

`dwarfvariants_x86_64` (10560 bytes, source vendored alongside as
`dwarfvariants_x86_64.rs`): built with the same rustc 1.90.0 as the fixtures
above but with **debug info on**, which is the whole point --
`rustc -C opt-level=1 -C debuginfo=2 -C relocation-model=static -C panic=abort
-C link-arg=-nostartfiles -C link-arg=-static dwarfvariants_x86_64.rs -o
dwarfvariants_x86_64`. `-C debuginfo=2` is what emits the `DW_TAG_variant_part`
DIEs; without it a Rust binary carries no type DIEs at all and `option
dwarfvariants` recovers nothing (this is stated as a limitation, not engineered
around). `-C opt-level=1` rather than `2` keeps each `#[inline(never)]` function
a recognisable one-shape body; `-C relocation-model=static` fixes the VMAs so the
stage testcase can name addresses. `#![no_std]` + `-C link-arg=-nostartfiles`
keeps the image at 10 KB with the full DWARF still present.

`dwarfvariants_overlay_x86_64` (8256 bytes, source vendored alongside as
`dwarfvariants_overlay_x86_64.rs`): same recipe and same reasons as
`dwarfvariants_x86_64` above --
`rustc -C opt-level=1 -C debuginfo=2 -C relocation-model=static -C panic=abort
-C target-feature=+crt-static -C link-arg=-nostartfiles
dwarfvariants_overlay_x86_64.rs -o dwarfvariants_overlay_x86_64`. It exists as a
SECOND fixture rather than extra functions in the first because the first one's
VMAs are pinned by the stage testcase and by this table.

`arm_thumb_le32.o` (904 bytes, source vendored alongside as `arm_thumb_le32.c`):
built with `clang --target=arm-linux-gnueabihf -mthumb -nostdlib -c
arm_thumb_le32.c -o arm_thumb_le32.o`. The two `__attribute__((target("thumb")))`
functions force Thumb codegen so the assembler lays the `$t` mapping symbol; the
FUNC symbols carry the LSB-set st_value Thumb convention. **It is a bare ET_REL
`.o`, NOT a linked executable** — this build host has no ARM linker (no lld;
gold/mold are x86-only builds; system `ld` rejects `armelf_linux_eabi`). The
symbol scan unit-tests against the `.o` (which `object` parses fine); the decode
**e2e** uses the LINKED `arm_thumb_linked_le32` (below).

`arm_thumb_linked_le32` (1080 bytes, source vendored alongside as
`arm_thumb_linked_le32.c`): the LINKED counterpart to the bare `.o`, built **in
the `kuna-dev` container** (arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc 11.4.0) with
`arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -mthumb -static -nostdlib -e _start arm_thumb_linked_le32.c -o arm_thumb_linked_le32`.
`-mthumb` forces Thumb codegen (the assembler lays the `$t` mapping symbol; the
linker records the STT_FUNC symbols at `entry|1`); `-static -nostdlib -e _start`
keeps it tiny and self-contained. It is a real **ET_EXEC with a PT_LOAD R E
segment** (`readelf -h` Type EXEC / Machine ARM; `readelf -l` one LOAD R E at
`0x10000`), so `ObjectLoadImage` (segments-only) loads it — the property the bare
`.o` lacked. `compute` is `x*3 + 7` (non-trivial Thumb arithmetic) so a correct
Thumb decode is visibly distinct from an ARM-mode misdecode. Drives the deferred
Increment-8/17 decode **e2e** (`kuna-console/tests/verify_arm_thumb_decode.rs`).

`arm_thumb_switch_le32` (1304 bytes, source vendored alongside as
`arm_thumb_switch_le32.c`): the jump-table sibling of `arm_thumb_linked_le32`,
built the same way **in the `kuna-dev` container** with
`arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -mthumb -Os -static -nostdlib -e _start arm_thumb_switch_le32.c -o arm_thumb_switch_le32`.
`-Os` is what makes gcc pick the dense `tbb [pc,r0]` form (a `-O0` build lowers
the same `switch` into a compare cascade with no table), and the four
`__attribute__((noinline))` leaf helpers keep a real `bl` inside the
table-reachable case blocks. That combination — a recovered jump table plus an
injected user-op inside the blocks only the table reaches — is the shape that
exposed the P2 injection-drain gap; the stage testcase
`tests/stages/ghdec-isamode-inject.xml` loads this file and asserts the emitted
C carries no `setISAMode`.

`mcount_x86_64`: `gcc -pg -static -O0 -o mcount_x86_64 t.c` (t.c = `int
main(){return 0;}`), then `strip --strip-debug` (drops `.debug_*` but keeps
`.symtab`, so the `mcount`/`__fentry__`/`main` FUNC symbols survive). It is
**static** on purpose: a dynamic `-pg` build resolves `mcount` to an *indirect*
GOT call (`call *0x…(%rip)`), which has no named-`mcount` FunctionSymbol at the
call target, so the name-matched fixup cannot bind — only the static build emits a
direct `call mcount` to a real `mcount` FUNC symbol. Static glibc makes this
fixture larger (~896 KB) than the others; that size is the unavoidable cost of a
self-contained direct-`call mcount` target.

`alignednew_x86_64` (source vendored alongside as `alignednew_x86_64.s`): built
locally with
`gcc -nostdlib -static -no-pie -Wl,-Ttext=0x401000 -o alignednew_x86_64 alignednew_x86_64.s`
and NOT stripped, so `callee` / `caller` / `_start` are `STT_FUNC` and the probe
can select `caller` by name. The two things that must not drift if it is ever
rebuilt: `callee` has to be reached from BOTH arms of the size test (one witness,
one loser), and the losing arm has to be the one laid out SECOND and entered by a
forward branch, because that is what makes its call spec finalize first and so
puts it out of `calleearity`'s reach. VMAs: `callee`=`0x401000`,
`caller`=`0x401010`, `_start`=`0x401050`.

`aif_gap_x86_64` (source vendored alongside as `aif_gap_x86_64.c`): built locally
with
`gcc -O0 -fpie -pie -fcf-protection=none -fno-stack-protector -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-unwind-tables -o aif_gap_x86_64 aif_gap_x86_64.c`
then `strip aif_gap_x86_64`. The 24 `h0..h23` handlers share an identical prologue
(they differ only by an operand immediate, the operand-insensitive fingerprint
equivalence class) and are all called directly from `main` so the Listing walk
reaches them (≥ 20 functions); `hidden_handler` is referenced ONLY from the const
`.rodata` function-pointer `table` (an `R_X86_64_RELATIVE` reloc) and called
indirectly, so no oracle / static CALL reaches it — it is the AIF gap target. The
`-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-unwind-tables` flags strip the `.eh_frame`
FDEs from the program functions (so the `.eh_frame` FDE entry oracle cannot find
`hidden_handler`); `-fcf-protection=none` keeps the prologues `endbr64`-free so the
fingerprint is the plain frame setup. The VMAs (`hidden_handler`=`0x13ae`,
`main`=`0x13c9`, `h0`=`0x1129`, `table`=`0x3df0`) are pinned by
`kuna-console/tests/verify_aif.rs`. **PIE** so the `_start`→`main`
`lea rdi,[rip+main]` idiom (`s1_entry` oracle 4) recovers `main` and seeds the walk.

**No Go fixture is vendored** (the Golang no-return list, Increment 15). Go ELF
binaries are unavoidably large — `go build` emits **~1.1 MB** un-stripped (the
whole runtime is statically embedded) and **~750 KB** stripped — and the
coverage tradeoff is forced: a *stripped* Go binary keeps `.go.buildinfo` (so
`detect_compiler` ⇒ `Go`) but drops `.symtab` entirely (so there is no
`runtime.gopanic` FUNC symbol for the no-return matcher), while only the
*un-stripped* 1.1 MB build carries both. Rather than vendor a 1.1 MB blob, the Go
e2e (`s1_loader::noreturn::tests::real_go_binary_detected_and_flags_runtime_gopanic`)
**builds a tiny real Go program at test runtime** (`go build` into an isolated
temp dir with a private GOCACHE/GOPATH), **guarded on `go` being on PATH** —
skipping cleanly otherwise (the same off-host-toolchain posture as the ARM-link
follow-up). It asserts both halves on a genuine Go binary: `detect_compiler == Go`
AND `runtime.gopanic`/`runtime.throw`/`runtime.goexit.abi0` flagged no-return
under the Go arm but not the C arm. The list-parse/matching logic itself is pinned
hermetically (no fixture, always runs) by `golang_list_gated_on_go_detection` and
the `s1_sourcelang` list tests.

`fmt_x86_64` (~16 KB, source vendored alongside as `fmt_x86_64.c`): built with
`gcc -no-pie -fno-stack-protector -O0 -o fmt_x86_64 fmt_x86_64.c` where
`fmt_x86_64.c` = `int main(int argc,char**argv){printf("%d %s\n", argc,
argv[0]); return 0;}` (kept **un**stripped so `main`/`printf` resolve by name).
The `-no-pie` keeps the format-string constant a fixed absolute address
(`.rodata` vma 0x402004) so the per-call-site format-constant read is
deterministic. Drives the `FormatStringAnalyzer` half-B console gate
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_s1_formatstring.rs`).

`operand_refs_x86_64` (~15 KB, source vendored alongside as
`operand_refs_x86_64.c`): built with
`gcc -no-pie -fno-pic -mcmodel=large -fno-stack-protector -O0 -o operand_refs_x86_64 operand_refs_x86_64.c`,
kept **un**stripped so `main`/`mystery` resolve by name. The
**`-mcmodel=large`** is load-bearing: it forces gcc to materialize the `"hi"`
string address with a `movabs $0x402004,%rax` (a bare 64-bit immediate — the
address appears DIRECTLY in code), the exact case `ScalarOperandAnalyzer` reads as
a `Scalar` operand. Under the default small/medium model gcc `-O0` emits a
RIP-relative `lea 0xNNN(%rip)` instead, which computes the address as `pc +
displacement` (no bare scalar surfaces), so the pass would correctly find nothing —
faithful to Ghidra's `ADDRESSES_DO_NOT_APPEAR_DIRECTLY_IN_CODE` gate. `mystery` is
`__attribute__((noinline))` so it survives as a real `.text` function with **no
known prototype** (absent from the libproto table), and `"hi"` is 2 chars (< the
`StringLiteralPass` `min_len` 5) — so the `mystery("hi")` literal renders ONLY when
`operand_refs` types the operand, isolating this pass's contribution from
`s1_strings` + libproto. `main`@`0x40112e`, `mystery`@`0x401106`, the `"hi"` string
@`0x402004` (4-byte data prefix at `0x402000`). **Pin the VMAs as test consts**
(`nm`/`objdump -d`/`objdump -s -j .rodata`). Drives
`kuna-console/tests/verify_operand_refs.rs`.

`fmt_aarch64` (8880 bytes), `fmt_arm` (7816 bytes), `fmt_riscv64` (8472 bytes) —
the **cross-arch** counterparts of `fmt_x86_64`, each built in the `kuna-dev`
container from the same one-line source (`fmt_<arch>.c` =
`int main(int argc,char**argv){printf("%d %s\n", argc, argv[0]); return 0;}`),
kept **un**stripped so `main`/`printf` resolve by name. They drive the cross-arch
`FormatStringAnalyzer` half-B gate (`kuna-console/tests/verify_formatstring_crossarch.rs`).
Build commands (single root container invocation, `apt-get update` so the RISC-V
dev package — `crt1.o` + headers, not in the base image — is installable):
`docker run --rm --user root -v "$PWD":/w -w /w kuna-dev bash -lc 'apt-get update
>/dev/null && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libc6-dev-riscv64-cross
>/dev/null; F=decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures;
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -O0 -fno-stack-protector $F/fmt_aarch64.c -o $F/fmt_aarch64;
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -O0 -fno-stack-protector $F/fmt_arm.c -o $F/fmt_arm;
riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -O0 -fno-stack-protector $F/fmt_riscv64.c -o $F/fmt_riscv64'`
(Ubuntu gcc 11.4.0 for all three). All three link **dynamic PIE** (the default;
`-no-pie` is unnecessary here since the format-constant read goes through the
recovered IR, not a fixed absolute VMA). On AArch64/RISC-V the format address is
materialized directly (`adrp+add` / `auipc+addi`); on **ARM** it is loaded from a
read-only PC-relative literal pool, so the format-string loop enables
`readonlypropagate` for the decompile (see `verify_formatstring_crossarch.rs`).

`mips_gp_le32` (7684 bytes, source vendored alongside as `mips_gp_le32.c`): built
with `mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc -O1 -no-pie -o mips_gp_le32 mips_gp_le32.c` (Ubuntu
mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc 10.3.0). The dynamic (`-no-pie` but PIC libc) link keeps it
small (7684 bytes) while still emitting the PIC `$gp` prologue (`lui gp; addiu gp;
addu gp,gp,t9` in `_init`/`_fini`) and a `lw t9,-N(gp)` GOT call in `main` — the
`$gp`-relative loads `t9`-tracking must resolve. A **static** build (`-static`)
also works but is ~672 KB (static glibc), so the dynamic form is vendored. `t9.c`
uses a global `counter` + a `printf` call so the prologue sets `$gp`. The `_gp`
LOCAL symbol survives (not stripped) so `recover_gp_value` can read it.
`mips16_le32` (1584 bytes, source vendored alongside as `mips16_le32.c`): built
in the dev container with
`mips-linux-gnu-gcc -mips16 -O1 -no-pie -nostdlib -ffreestanding mips16_le32.c -o mips16_le32`
(Ubuntu mips-linux-gnu-gcc 10.3.0; big-endian — the `_le32` name follows the
sibling `mips_gp_le32`'s convention, endianness is in the ELF header).
**Freestanding** because the container ships the MIPS *runtime* libc but no
`libc6-dev` (no `crt1.o`/headers), so a normal libc link fails — and a decode
fixture needs no runtime, only a decodable MIPS16 body. `m16_square` is
`__attribute__((mips16)) int m16_square(int n){return n*n+3;}` (8 bytes:
`mult a0,a0; mflo v0; jr ra; addiu v0,3`); on this toolchain its STT_FUNC is
recorded at the EVEN entry (`0x400130`) with `st_other & 0xf0 == STO_MIPS_MIPS16`
(the binutils MIPS16 marker) — **not** an LSB-set odd address — exactly the
`MIPS_ElfExtension.applyIsaMode` st_other branch. Drives the MIPS16 `ISA_MODE`
painting unit tests (`s1_loader::mips_markers`) + the console e2e gate
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_mips16_isa.rs`), where it decodes to
`return a0 * a0 + 3;` (MIPS16) vs an empty `void` body (MIPS32 misdecode, the
BEFORE state).
`plt_aarch64` (9056 bytes, source vendored alongside as `plt_aarch64.c`): built
with `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -O0 -no-pie plt_aarch64.c -o plt_aarch64` (Ubuntu
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc 11.4.0, in the `kuna-dev` container —
`docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w kuna-dev bash -lc 'aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -O0
-no-pie decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/plt_aarch64.c -o
decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/plt_aarch64'`). The `-no-pie` keeps
it ET_EXEC with fixed PLT/GOT VMAs so the pinned stub/GOT consts in
`verify_aarch64_plt.rs` are deterministic; `main`/`puts`/`printf` are kept
**un**stripped so the local `main` resolves and the `.dynsym` import names back the
PLT veneers. Drives the AArch64 PLT import-name console gate
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_aarch64_plt.rs`).

`plt_riscv64` (8520 bytes, source vendored alongside as `plt_riscv64.c`): built
with `riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -O0 plt_riscv64.c -o plt_riscv64`
(`riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc 11.4.0`). `plt_riscv64.c` =
`int main(int argc,char**argv){ puts("hello"); printf("%d\n", argc); return 0; }`
— a normal dynamic RISC-V64 PIE (RVC, lp64d ABI), kept **un**stripped so `main`
resolves by name. It has a real `.plt` + `.rela.plt` (`DT_PLTGOT`=`0x2008`); the
`puts`/`printf` `R_RISCV_JUMP_SLOT` relocations name the GOT slots `0x2020`/`0x2028`,
and the 16-byte `auipc t3; ld t3,lo(t3); jalr t1,t3; nop` PLT veneers
(`puts@plt`=`0x5e0`, `printf@plt`=`0x5f0`) are exactly the form `elf_plt::decode_riscv`
recognizes. Drives the RISC-V PLT import-name console e2e
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_riscv64_plt.rs`). The build host's `kuna-dev` image ships
`libc6-riscv64-cross` (the shared libs) but not the dev package, so the cross-link needs
`libc6-dev-riscv64-cross` (headers + `crt1.o`) installed in the build container —
the exact build command (single root container invocation) is:
`docker run --rm --user root -v "$PWD":/w -w /w kuna-dev bash -lc 'apt-get update >/dev/null
&& apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libc6-dev-riscv64-cross >/dev/null
&& riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -O0 decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/plt_riscv64.c
-o decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/plt_riscv64'`.

`plt_sparc64` (12936 bytes, source vendored alongside as `plt_sparc64.c`): built
with `sparc64-linux-gnu-gcc -O0 plt_sparc64.c -o plt_sparc64`. `plt_sparc64.c` =
`int main(int argc,char**argv){ puts("hello"); printf("%d\n", argc); return 0; }`
— a normal dynamic SPARC v9 / ELF64 **big-endian** EXEC, kept **un**stripped so
`main` resolves by name. It has a real `.plt` (`0x202100`, 32-byte entries) +
`.rela.plt`; the `puts`/`printf` `R_SPARC_JMP_SLOT` relocations have `r_offset`
equal to their PLT entry addresses (`0x2021c0`/`0x2021a0` — on SPARC the linker
rewrites the in-place stub at resolution time, so the relocation offset IS the call
target, not a separate GOT word), and the 32-byte `sethi %hi(...),%g1; b,a %xcc,
<resolver>; nop*6` veneers are exactly the form `elf_plt::decode_sparc` recognizes.
Drives the SPARC PLT import-name console e2e (`kuna-console/tests/verify_sparc_plt.rs`).
Like the RISC-V fixture, the `kuna-dev` image ships `sparc64-linux-gnu-gcc` but not
the SPARC libc dev package, so the cross-link needs `libc6-dev-sparc64-cross`
(headers + `crt1.o`) installed in the build container — the exact build command
(single root container invocation) is:
`docker run --rm --user root -v "$PWD":/w -w /w kuna-dev bash -lc 'apt-get update >/dev/null

-o decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/plt_sparc64'`.

`entrymain_aarch64` / `entrymain_arm` / `entrymain_riscv64` (each <7 KB, shared
source `entrymain.c` = `int main(int c,char**v){return c;}`): the cross-arch
`_start`→`main` idiom fixtures (Increment 23). Built in the `kuna-dev` container
to recover `main` ONLY via the libc-start idiom — DYNAMIC (real crt1 `_start` →
`__libc_start_main(main,…)`), unwind tables dropped (`-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables
-fno-unwind-tables`, to keep `main` out of `.eh_frame`), `-fvisibility=hidden`
(so `main` is not exported in `.dynsym`), then stripped:

```
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w kuna-dev bash -lc '\
  <triple>-gcc -O0 -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-unwind-tables \
    -fvisibility=hidden entrymain.c -o <out> && <triple>-strip <out>'
```

with triples `aarch64-linux-gnu`, `arm-linux-gnueabihf`, `riscv64-linux-gnu`. The
RISC-V cross-libc is not in the base image — install it first (the same package
the MIPS/RISC-V ports used): `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y
libc6-dev-riscv64-cross`. Two non-obvious flags are load-bearing: **`-fvisibility=hidden`**
(plain builds leave `main` a `.dynsym` GLOBAL FUNC — on AArch64/ARM strip removes
it, but on RISC-V `.dynsym` entries are load-bearing and survive strip, so without
hidden visibility `main` would already be a funcsym and oracle 4 could not be shown
to contribute it); **`-fno-*-unwind-tables`** isolates oracle 4 from the `.eh_frame`
FDE oracle (AArch64/RISC-V still carry crt1 FDEs, but none cover `main`; ARM's
`.eh_frame` is fully empty). VMAs (`_start`/`main`/GOT slot) are pinned as test
consts in `s1_entry`'s tests + `kuna-console/tests/verify_crossarch_entry_main.rs`
(read via container `objdump`/`readelf`/`nm` at build time). Unlike the ARM `.o`,
these are LINKED PIE executables (ET_DYN + PT_LOAD), so the decode e2e runs.

`plt_ppc64le` (~21 KB, source vendored alongside as `plt_ppc64le.c`): built with
`powerpc64le-linux-gnu-gcc -O0 plt_ppc64le.c -o plt_ppc64le`
(Ubuntu powerpc64le-linux-gnu-gcc 11.4.0, in the `kuna-dev` container).
`plt_ppc64le.c` = `int main(int argc,char**argv){ puts("hello"); printf("%d\n",
argc); return 0; }` — a normal dynamic PPC64le **ELFv2** PIE, kept **un**stripped
so `main` resolves by name. ELFv2 has no `.plt` code section, so the linker
synthesizes the TOC-relative call stubs inline in `.text`
(`std r2,24(r1); addis r12,r2,off@ha; ld r12,off@l(r12); mtctr r12; bctr`) and the
`.plt` (NOBITS) slots carry the `puts`/`printf` `R_PPC64_JMP_SLOT` relocations —
exactly the form `elf_plt::decode_ppc64_stubs` recognizes (TOC base = `.got` vma +
`0x8000`, the ELFv2 convention). Drives the PowerPC64 PLT import-name console e2e
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_ppc64_plt.rs`). The build host's `kuna-dev` image ships

`plt_mips32` (7580 bytes, source vendored alongside as `plt_mips32.c`): built with
`mips-linux-gnu-gcc -O0 plt_mips32.c -o plt_mips32` (Ubuntu mips-linux-gnu-gcc
10.3.0, big-endian). `plt_mips32.c` =
`int main(int argc,char**argv){ puts("hello"); printf("%d\n", argc); return 0; }`
— a normal dynamic MIPS32 executable, kept **un**stripped so `main` resolves by
name. `-O0` keeps the libc calls **plain** `puts`/`printf` (an `-O1`+ build pulls
in glibc's fortified `__printf_chk`). It has **no `.plt` and no `R_MIPS_JUMP_SLOT`
relocations** — the o32 lazy-binding layout uses `.MIPS.stubs` + a `$gp`-relative
GOT, so import names come from the dynamic-symbol GOT correspondence
(`DT_MIPS_LOCAL_GOTNO`/`DT_MIPS_GOTSYM`/`DT_PLTGOT`), exactly the form
`elf_plt::resolve_mips_imports` decodes. Drives the MIPS import-name console e2e
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_mips_plt.rs`). The build host's `kuna-dev` image ships

## PE (Windows) fixtures — the multi-format loader (PR-3+4)

`pe_imports.exe` (non-stripped, 487 KB) and `pe_imports_stripped.exe` (`-s`,
38 KB) are **linked Windows PE32+** executables for the PE import-naming gate
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_pe_imports.rs`, design §3.2). Both are built from
`pe_imports.c` =
`int main(int argc,char**argv){ puts("hello"); printf("%d\n", argc); return 0; }`
with MinGW-w64 in the `kuna-dev` container (`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`, shipped by
the dev image):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w kuna-dev bash -lc \
  'x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -O1 pe_imports.c \
     -o decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/pe_imports.exe'
# stripped variant (the PR-4 IAT-naming proof): add `-s`.
```

ImageBase `0x140000000`. `main`@`0x140001592` calls `puts` through a MinGW thunk
veneer@`0x140007240` (`FF 25` `jmp [rip+disp]` → the `__imp_puts` IAT slot
@`0x14000d33c`) and a *local* MinGW `printf` wrapper@`0x140001550` (a `.text`
function, **not** an import — it internally calls `vfprintf`). In the
**non-stripped** exe the COFF symtab names the thunk (`puts`) and the wrapper
(`printf`); in the **stripped** exe those names are gone, so the `puts` call is
named **only** by `s1_loader::pe_iat`'s Import-Directory walk + `FF 25` thunk
decode — that's the load-bearing PR-4 proof. The local `printf` wrapper stays
`sub_<addr>` in the stripped binary (correctly — it is not an import). The PE
exe is the only non-ELF binary in this tree large enough to statically link the
MinGW CRT (≈0.5 MB), on par with the existing `mcount_x86_64` (0.9 MB).
**Pin the VMAs as test consts** (`x86_64-w64-mingw32-objdump -d/-p`).

`pe_noreturn_import.exe` (6173 B, PE32+/x86-64, source `pe_noreturn_import.c`) is the
PE **import-call binding** fixture (`--option peimportcall`, `tests/stages/ghdec-peimportcall.xml`).
Its point is the one call shape `pe_imports.exe` does not have: a *direct indirect*
`call [__imp_ExitProcess]` through an Import Address Table slot, forced with
`__declspec(dllimport)` (the shape MSVC emits for every Win32 call, and the shape kuna
could not resolve — the CALLIND target is the contents of a global, so `ActionDeindirect`
needs `Varnode::externref` on it). `bail`@`0x140001000` ends in that call; `tally`@`0x140001010`
is deliberately the next function in `.text` and deliberately contains a loop, so an overrun
past the unbound call is visible in one line of C; `entry`@`0x140001040` calls `bail` under a
condition, so the dead fall-through after the bound no-return call is visible too. ImageBase
`0x140000000`, IAT slot `0x140005038`, MinGW `FF 25` veneer `0x140001070`. The same two
call sites make it the **IAT call-edge** fixture (`kuna-console/tests/verify_iatcall.rs`,
CLI probe `tests/cli/imported-call-has-no-callee-edge.json`, GH-456): each is a call edge
to `ExitProcess` rather than a read of a pointer. The veneer's `JMP qword ptr
[0x140005038]` is a jump edge to the same import slot, recovering its forwarding
call-graph edge while unified inbound queries exclude it as alias-internal. Built with
MinGW-w64 in the `kuna-dev` container (the same toolchain as
`pe_imports.exe`):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w kuna-dev bash -lc \
  'x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -O1 -nostdlib -Wl,-e,entry \
     decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/pe_noreturn_import.c \
     -o decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/pe_noreturn_import.exe -lkernel32'
```

`libcsigs_pe_x86_64.exe` (1536 B, generated by the adjacent Python script) is
the duplicate-name libc-prototype fixture. Its caller at `0x140001000` reaches
`memcmp` through the `FF 25` veneer at `0x140001080`; the import resolver also
names the IAT slot at `0x140002050` as imported `memcmp`, while reporting a
same-named defined export at `0x140001060` with distinct provenance. The caller
keeps RDX and R8 live through a length comparison, then calls the veneer with
RCX set last. Previously, a by-name prototype park reached only one of the
symbols and rendered `memcmp(0x140002100)`; the import/export spelling collision
now suppresses that unsafe global park. Parking the three-argument `libcsigs`
prototype on both provenance-confirmed import addresses—but not on the defined export—
renders `memcmp((void *)0x140002100,(void *)0x140002110,3)`. Regenerate with:

```bash
python3 decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/libcsigs_pe_x86_64.py
```

`coff_obj.obj` (Intel amd64 COFF object, <1 KB) is a **pre-link COFF object** for
the PR-5 object-loader gate (`kuna-console/tests/verify_coff_object.rs`,
design §3.6). Built (no new packages — `clang` ships in `kuna-dev`):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w kuna-dev bash -lc \
  'clang -target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu -O1 -c coff_obj.c \
     -o decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/coff_obj.obj'
```

`coff_obj.c` =
`int compute(int x){ return x*3+1; }` /
`int run(int n){ const char *s="hi"; puts(s); return compute(n)+(int)s[0]; }`.
COFF symtab (`objdump -t`): `compute`@`.text`+0x0, `run`@+0x10, `puts` an
**undefined** external (section 0) — a pre-link object has no IAT, so `puts` is an
unresolved *symbol*, not an address (`CoffFormat::resolve_imports` empty, §3.6).
The `"hi"` literal lands in `.rdata` (the format-agnostic string pass's input).
`compute` sits at `.text`+0, exercising the defined-function-at-VMA-0 case the
loader's `is_undefined()` funcsym skip handles (an `addr == 0` skip would have
dropped it). Proves a COFF `.obj` loads and decompiles a function **resolved by
its COFF-symtab name**.

`msvc_mangled.obj` (Intel amd64 COFF object, <1 KB) is a **COFF object carrying
MSVC C++ mangled symbols** for the PR-9 demangler gate
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_msvc_demangle.rs` +
`loadimage_object::tests::msvc_mangled_coff_symbols_are_demangled_name_only`,
design §5.5). `cl.exe` is unavailable on Linux, but `clang -target
x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` emits the *same* `?`-prefixed MSVC mangling (the MSVC C++
ABI — verified `objdump -t`), so this is a **real** MSVC fixture, not a hand-faked
symtab. Built (no new packages — `clang` ships in `kuna-dev`):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w kuna-dev bash -lc \
  'clang -target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -O1 -c msvc_mangled.cpp \
     -o decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures/msvc_mangled.obj'
```

`msvc_mangled.cpp` =
`int Bar::foo(int x){ return x*3+1; }` (member, `?foo@Bar@@QEAAHH@Z`) /
`int ns::g(int a,int b){ return a*b+7; }` (namespaced, `?g@ns@@YAHHH@Z`) /
`int freefunc(int x){ return x+42; }` (free, `?freefunc@@YAHH@Z`). The loader's
MSVC demangle arm rewrites each `?`-symbol to its qualified name-only form
(`Bar::foo`, `ns::g`, `freefunc`); `freefunc` decompiles to `a0 + 0x2a` resolved
by that demangled name. Note `strip_version` (the glibc `@@VERSION` stripper) is
guarded to NOT truncate a leading-`?` name (MSVC uses `@` structurally), or every
MSVC symbol would arrive at the demangler cut to `?foo`.

`msvc_rtti_x64.exe` (3584 B, PE32+/x86-64) and `msvc_rtti_x86.exe` (3072 B, PE32/x86)
are **linked Windows PEs carrying the real MSVC C++ RTTI / vftable ABI** in
`.rdata`/`.data`, for the MSVC RTTI class-name recovery gate
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_rtti.rs`, the `s1_rtti` pass, `--option rtti on`). Both
are the same source `msvc_rtti.cpp` (one polymorphic base class `Shape` + one
derived class `Box` with a virtual method) linked for two arches — proving the
recovery is arch-independent (x64 = image-base-relative `IBO32` refs + RTTI0 name at
offset 16; x86 = raw-VA refs + name at offset 8). `cl.exe` is unavailable on Linux,
but `clang -target {x86_64,i686}-pc-windows-msvc -fuse-ld=lld` emits the *same* MSVC
C++ RTTI ABI (the real `CompleteObjectLocator` / RTTI{0..3} bytes in `.rdata`,
verified by `objdump -s -j .rdata`), so these are **real** RTTI PEs, not hand-faked
tables. The `msvc_mangled.obj` recipe already proved `clang` emits the MSVC C++ ABI;
a *linked* PE with a populated `.rdata` is the new need — supplied by `-fuse-ld=lld`
(`lld-link`) + a one-cell inline-asm stub for the CRT `type_info` vftable
(`??_7type_info@@6B@`) the RTTI Type Descriptors reference, so the image links
freestanding (`-nostdlib`) while keeping the genuine RTTI bytes. Built in `kuna-dev`
(no new packages — `clang` + `lld-link` ship in the image):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w kuna-dev bash -lc '
  F=decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures
  clang -target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -fuse-ld=lld -O1 -nostdlib \
    -Wl,-subsystem:console -Wl,-entry:mainCRTStartup \
    $F/msvc_rtti.cpp -o $F/msvc_rtti_x64.exe
  clang -target i686-pc-windows-msvc   -fuse-ld=lld -O1 -nostdlib \
    -Wl,-subsystem:console -Wl,-entry:mainCRTStartup \
    $F/msvc_rtti.cpp -o $F/msvc_rtti_x86.exe'
```

Pinned VMAs (from `x86_64-w64-mingw32-objdump -s -j .rdata/.data -d -j .text` + `-p` ImageBase):

| | ImageBase | Box `TypeDescriptor` (RTTI0) | Shape `TypeDescriptor` | Box `CompleteObjectLocator` (RTTI4) | Box vftable | Box vftable slot 0 (`Box::area`) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **x64** | `0x140000000` | `0x140003010` (`.?AUBox@@`) | `0x140003030` (`.?AVShape@@`/`.?AUShape@@`) | `0x140002020` | `0x140002010` | `0x140001040` |
| **x86** | `0x400000` | `0x403010` (`.?AUBox@@`) | `0x403030` (`.?AUShape@@`) | `0x402010` | `0x40200c` | `0x401030` |

With `--option rtti on` the recovery labels the Box `TypeDescriptor`
`Box::RTTI_Type_Descriptor`, the COL `Box::RTTI_Complete_Object_Locator`, the vftable
`Box::vftable`, and the Shape `TypeDescriptor` `Shape::RTTI_Type_Descriptor` — so
`Box`/`Shape` surface as recovered C++ class names; default-off (`rtti off`) they are
absent (the parity proof). The `.?A…@@` names demangle through the existing MSVC
demangler via the Ghidra `RttiUtil` `??_R0…@8` wrap (clang renders `struct` classes
as `.?AU…`; both `V`/`U` recover the bare name).

**vftable discovery + virtual-method naming (R3).** Each recovered class's vftable is
walked from its `Box::vftable` base (`VfTableModel.getVfTableCount`), bounding the slot
array at the first NULL / non-`.text` slot. The Box vftable holds exactly one slot —
`Box::area` (`return side*side;`, the pinned slot-0 target above: `0x140001040` x64 /
`0x401030` x86) — which R3 names `Box::vfunc_0` (a `SymKind::Function`) and marks the
slot array read-only. The slots are **absolute VAs on both arches** (NOT the `IBO32`
displacements the COL/RTTI inter-struct refs use): the x64 vftable cell at `0x140002010`
holds the full 8-byte `0x140001040`, the x86 cell at `0x40200c` the 4-byte `0x401030`.
`kuna-console/tests/verify_rtti.rs` asserts `Box::vfunc_0` exists AND a function symbol
resolves at the slot-0 target VA (the virtual dispatch now points at a named method),
absent with `rtti off`. The slot function's stem is `vfunc_`, never `vftable_`: only the
table data object wears a `vftable` name, so a function inventory never reports an
executable range as a vtable.

## Mach-O (Apple) fixtures — the multi-format loader (PR-6+7, the Mach-O headline)

`macho_imports` (x86-64, 16 KB) and `macho_imports_arm64` (arm64, 49 KB) are
**linked Mach-O** executables for the Mach-O import-naming gate
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_macho_imports.rs`, design §3.3). Both are the *same*
source `macho_imports.c` =
`int compute(int n){return n*3+7;} int main(int argc,char**argv){ printf("%d\n", compute(argc)); return 0; }`
(`printf` declared, no header) linked for two arches — proving the `__stubs`
naming is arch-independent. Built in the `kuna-dev` container with bare `clang`
(no macOS SDK) + the rustup-bundled `ld64.lld` (an LLD darwin flavor); the
classic `S_SYMBOL_STUBS` indirect-symbol layout PR-7 walks is what `ld64.lld`
emits. `-undefined dynamic_lookup` lets `_printf` stay external:

```bash
# (x86_64; arm64 = -target arm64-apple-macos11 + -arch arm64)
clang -target x86_64-apple-macos11 -O1 -c macho_imports.c -o m.o
LLD=$(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib/$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's/host: //p')/bin/gcc-ld/ld64.lld
"$LLD" -arch x86_64 -platform_version macos 11.0 11.0 \
       -undefined dynamic_lookup -e _main -o macho_imports m.o
```

ImageBase `0x100000000` (PIE). `main` reaches `printf` by a **direct branch to
the `__TEXT,__stubs` entry** — x86-64 `callq 0x1000005cc`, arm64
`bl 0x1000005a0` — so there is no slot to constant-fold; naming the stub entry
(`sec.addr + i*reserved2`) is enough and arch-independent. The name comes from
the `LC_DYSYMTAB` indirect-symbol table → `LC_SYMTAB` (`_printf`, `_` stripped).
Pinned VMAs (x86-64): `_compute`@`0x1000005a0`, `_main`@`0x1000005b0`, the
`printf` stub@`0x1000005cc`. The defined `_main` keeps its leading `_` (it comes
from the `file.symbols()` funcsym source, not the stub resolver). **Pin the VMAs
as test consts** (`llvm-objdump --macho -d` / `llvm-otool -Iv`).

`macho_import_slots` (x86-64, 13 KB) isolates the direct import-pointer call
shape for `peimportcall`. `_call_slots`@`0x1000003c0` first calls
`_objc_msgSend` through the typed `__DATA_CONST,__got` non-lazy symbol-pointer
entry at `0x100001000`, then calls through an ordinary 16-byte
`__DATA,__objc_msgrefs` record at `0x100002000`. Both pointers name the same
undefined symbol at link time, but only the first appears in `LC_DYSYMTAB`'s
typed indirect-symbol table. The fixture therefore proves both the binding and
the exclusion of arbitrary Objective-C message-reference data. Rebuild with:

```bash
clang -target x86_64-apple-macos11 -c macho_import_slots.s -o m.o
LLD=$(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib/$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's/host: //p')/bin/gcc-ld/ld64.lld
"$LLD" -arch x86_64 -platform_version macos 11.0 11.0 \
       -undefined dynamic_lookup -e _call_slots -o macho_import_slots m.o
```

## Mach-O fat/universal + arm64e (PR-8)

The fat/universal + arm64e gate (`kuna-console/tests/verify_macho_fat.rs`, design
§3.4 / §3.7) reuses the two thin `macho_imports*` slices above:

- **`macho_fat`** (2-slice universal, ~97 KB) wraps `macho_imports` (x86-64,
  slice 0) + `macho_imports_arm64` (arm64, slice 1) behind a big-endian
  `fat_header` + two `fat_arch` records. `llvm-lipo`/`lipo` are **absent** in the
  container, so the fat wrapper is **hand-built** directly from the two real thin
  slices (the fat format is just a header + per-slice
  `{cputype,cpusubtype,offset,size,align}`; both slices page-aligned at
  `2^14`). The dispatch peels one slice (default x86-64; `--slice arm64` selects
  the other) before `object::File::parse`, which cannot parse a fat header.
  Rebuild: the Python snippet in `Increment 45` of the retired analysis-port log (git history)
  (read each thin slice's header, emit the wrapper) — or `llvm-lipo a b -create
  -output macho_fat` if a `lipo` is available.

- **`macho_arm64e`** (~49 KB) is the `macho_imports_arm64` fixture with its header
  `cpusubtype` flipped to `CPU_SUBTYPE_ARM64E` (2). arm64e is binary-compatible
  arm64 (same encodings plus PAC), so the real arm64 code decodes under the
  AppleSilicon v8.5-A superset spec. With `--option macho-arm64e on` the loader
  selects `AARCH64:LE:64:AppleSilicon`; off ⇒ generic `v8A`. The **load +
  spec-selection path is real**; only the cpusubtype is synthesized (no
  `clang -arch arm64e` SDK in-container — a genuine Apple-toolchain arm64e binary
  is a follow-up). Rebuild: copy `macho_imports_arm64` and overwrite the 4-byte
  cpusubtype at offset 8 with little-endian `2`.

## Mach-O Objective-C metadata (the `s1_objc` headline)

`macho_objc` (x86-64, ~16 KB) is a self-contained Objective-C Mach-O for the
ObjC metadata-recovery gate (`kuna-console/tests/verify_objc.rs`, the kuna
analog of Ghidra's `ObjcTypeMetadataAnalyzer`). Source `macho_objc.m` uses a
**root class** (`objc_root_class`) so it needs **no macOS SDK / Foundation** —
bare `clang` synthesizes the `__objc_*` metadata from the `@interface`/
`@implementation` alone:

```objc
__attribute__((objc_root_class)) @interface Greeter @end
@implementation Greeter
- (int)greet:(int)n { return n*3+7; }
@end
int main(){ return 0; }
```

Built in the `kuna-dev` container (or on a host with `clang` + the rustup
`ld64.lld`) with the **exact `macho_imports` recipe**, plus `-x` (strip local
symbols) so the IMP `-[Greeter greet:]` has NO leftover symbol — only the
`__objc_*` metadata recovers the name:

```bash
clang -target x86_64-apple-macos11 -fobjc-arc -O1 -c macho_objc.m -o m.o
LLD=$(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib/$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's/host: //p')/bin/gcc-ld/ld64.lld
"$LLD" -arch x86_64 -platform_version macos 11.0 11.0 \
       -undefined dynamic_lookup -x -e _main -o macho_objc m.o
```

ImageBase `0x100000000` (PIE). The metadata chain the pass walks:
`__DATA_CONST,__objc_classlist[0]` → `class_t`@`0x100003000` →
(`data & ~0x7`) `class_ro_t`@`0x100003098` → `.name`=`"Greeter"`,
`.baseMethods` → the **small/relative** `method_list_t`@`0x10000066c`
(`entsizeAndFlags=0x8000000c`, count 1) → `method_t` selector `"greet:"`
(via a selref), types `"i20@0:8i16"`, **IMP**@`0x100000640`. The metaclass
(`isa`@`0x100003028`) has no `+` methods. **Pinned VMAs** (`llvm-objdump
--macho -d` / a manual Mach-O parse): IMP `-[Greeter greet:]`@`0x100000640`,
`class_t Greeter`@`0x100003000`, `class_ro_t`@`0x100003098`,
`method_list_t`@`0x10000066c`. With `--option objc on` the IMP renders
`-[Greeter greet:]`; off, it is `sub_100000640`. x86-64, **no chained fixups**
(the clang on this toolchain emits classic `LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY` rebase opcodes,
like `macho_imports`) — so this slice is also the **no-op proof** for the
chained-fixup resolver (the resolver yields an empty overlay here, and `read_ptr`
reads raw section words exactly as before).

`macho_objc_odd_imp` is the x86-64 low-bit regression twin. Its assembly source
is the same root-class metadata shape with one byte before the method label, so
the absolute `method_t.imp` is the valid odd address `0x100000641`. The byte at
`0x100000640` is padding; decompiling there demonstrates the incorrect rounding,
while the odd entry returns `n * 3 + 7`. Rebuild it without an Apple SDK:

```bash
clang -target x86_64-apple-macos11 -c macho_objc_odd_imp.s -o m.o
LLD=$(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib/$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's/host: //p')/bin/gcc-ld/ld64.lld
"$LLD" -arch x86_64 -platform_version macos 11.0 11.0 \
       -undefined dynamic_lookup -x -e _main -o macho_objc_odd_imp m.o
```

### `macho_objc_arm64` — the chained-fixup + arm64 slice (PR-O0 + PR-O2)

`macho_objc_arm64` (arm64, ~49 KB) is the **same `macho_objc.m` source** built for
arm64 **with a real `LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS`** — the prerequisite for arm64 ObjC.
The only build-recipe change vs the x86-64 slice is the `-arch arm64` target and
the **`-fixup_chains`** linker flag, which makes `ld64.lld` emit chained fixups
(`LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS` + `LC_DYLD_EXPORTS_TRIE`) instead of the classic
`LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY` rebase opcodes:

```bash
clang -target arm64-apple-macos11 -fobjc-arc -O1 -c macho_objc.m -o m.o
LLD=$(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib/$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's/host: //p')/bin/gcc-ld/ld64.lld
"$LLD" -arch arm64 -platform_version macos 11.0 11.0 -fixup_chains \
       -undefined dynamic_lookup -x -e _main -o macho_objc_arm64 m.o
```

Confirm it carries the chained fixups: `llvm-otool -l macho_objc_arm64 | grep
CHAINED` (or a load-command dump shows `LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS dataoff=0xc000
datasize=0x80`). ImageBase `0x100000000` (PIE), `DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_64` (format 2,
4-byte stride). The metadata chain (read through the resolver): `__DATA_CONST,
__objc_classlist[0]` (a chained-fixup slot resolving to) → `class_t`@`0x100008000`
→ (`data & ~0x7`) `class_ro_t`@`0x100008098` → `.name`=`"Greeter"`, `.baseMethods`
→ the small/relative `method_list_t`@`0x100000618` → selector `"greet:"`, types
`"i20@0:8i16"`, **IMP**@`0x1000005f0`. **Pinned VMAs:** IMP@`0x1000005f0`,
`class_t`@`0x100008000`, `class_ro_t`@`0x100008098`, classlist slot@`0x100004000`
(raw word `0x0000000100008000`, resolves to `0x100008000`); `class_t.isa`
slot@`0x100008000` (raw word `0x0020000100008028`, **resolves to `0x100008028`** —
the raw word would be garbage without the resolver, since the `next=4` field leaks
into the high bits). With `--option objc on` the IMP renders `-[Greeter greet:]`;
off, it is `sub_1000005f0`.

The resolver (PR-O0, `s1_loader/format/macho/chained.rs`) handles plain rebase
(`DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_64`/`_64_OFFSET`) + arm64e auth-rebase
(`DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_ARM64E`/`_USERLAND`, PAC bits stripped); **bind/import-ordinal
chains are out of scope** (an external symbol's runtime address is unknown
statically, so a bind slot is left unresolved — the consumer reads the raw word
and falls back, never a wrong address). The container's in-tree `ld64.lld` emits a
`DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_64` (format 2) arm64 fixture; the arm64e auth-rebase path is
covered by the resolver's synthetic-bit-pattern unit tests
(`decode_arm64e_auth_rebase_strips_pac` et al.) since the in-container linker does
not emit an arm64e auth-fixup slice.

## Stripped-PE / stripped-Mach-O entry discovery (PR-12+13)

The multi-format **entry-discovery** gate
(`kuna-console/tests/verify_multiformat_entry.rs`, design §4.1 / §5.3) proves a
*stripped* PE/Mach-O recovers its function starts with **no `--addr`**, exactly
as a stripped ELF does (`verify_s1_entry`). The two PE/Mach-O *import* fixtures
above are reused, plus one new stripped Mach-O:

- **PE:** `pe_imports_stripped.exe` (already above) — fully stripped (0 symbols,
  0 exports). The `s1_entry` PE oracles recover its functions from the entry
  point (`AddressOfEntryPoint`@`0x1400014f0`) and the **`.pdata`** exception
  directory (97 `RUNTIME_FUNCTION` records — the `.eh_frame` analog), incl.
  `main`@`0x140001592`. A bare load finds nothing; the oracles find dozens.

- **Mach-O:** `macho_func_starts_stripped` (x86-64, 16 KB) is a **stripped**
  Mach-O whose `helper`@`0x100000590` is `static` (file-local), so `ld64.lld -x`
  removes its symbol — leaving **`LC_FUNCTION_STARTS`** as the only source that
  recovers it. `macho_func_starts_stripped.c` =
  `static int helper(int n){return n*7+3;} int main(int argc,char**argv){ printf("%d\n", helper(argc)); return 0; }`.

  ```bash
  LLD=$(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib/$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's/host: //p')/bin/gcc-ld/ld64.lld
  clang -target x86_64-apple-macos11 -O0 -fno-inline -c macho_func_starts_stripped.c -o m.o
  "$LLD" -arch x86_64 -platform_version macos 11.0 11.0 -undefined dynamic_lookup \
         -e _main -x -dead_strip -o macho_func_starts_stripped m.o
  ```

  `LC_FUNCTION_STARTS` decodes (ULEB128 deltas off `__TEXT`@`0x100000000`) to
  `[0x100000550 (_main, still symboled — the entry), 0x100000590 (helper,
  stripped)]`. `collect_entries` skips the symboled `_main` and **discovers
  `0x100000590`** — the never-symboled `helper` — the load-bearing PR-13 proof.

## DWARF on MinGW-PE / Mach-O (PR-11)

The multi-format **DWARF** gate (`kuna-console/tests/verify_multiformat_dwarf.rs`,
design §5.2 / §8 PR-11) proves the `s1_dwarf` pass (gimli) recovers DWARF function
names + typed signatures on PE and Mach-O, not just ELF. Both fixtures are the
per-format analog of `dwarf_stripped_x86_64`: the function names live **only** in
the debug sections (the symtab FUNC entries are stripped/renamed, `.debug_*` kept),
so a recovery by name is unambiguously DWARF-sourced. Shared source (no headers,
so it cross-compiles to macOS without an SDK; `pe_dwarf.c` / `macho_dwarf.c` carry
the identical bodies + their build recipes):
`int first_byte(char *label){return label[0];} int add(int a,int b){return a+b;} int main(void){return first_byte("kuna")+add(2,3);}`.

- **`pe_dwarf.exe`** (MinGW `-g`, ~70 KB): MinGW emits standard `.debug_*` sections
  in the PE, which `object::section_by_name(".debug_info")` finds verbatim. Built
  in the `kuna-dev` container, then the COFF-symtab FUNC entries removed (keeping
  `.debug_*`):

  ```bash
  x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -g -O0 pe_dwarf.c -o pe_g.exe
  x86_64-w64-mingw32-objcopy --strip-symbol first_byte --strip-symbol add \
      --strip-symbol main  pe_g.exe  pe_dwarf.exe
  ```

  Pinned VMAs (ImageBase `0x140000000`): `first_byte`@`0x140001550`,
  `add`@`0x140001564`. DWARF recovers `int4 first_byte(char *a0)` by name; a
  by-`load addr 0x140001550` decompile (the no-DWARF-name baseline) renders the
  engine's `sub_140001550` placeholder.

- **`macho_dwarf.o`** (clang `-g`, relocatable, ~2 KB): the DWARF lands in the
  `__DWARF,__debug_*` sections; `object` maps gimli's `.debug_info` → the Mach-O
  short-name `__debug_info` (its documented rule), so the *same* section loader
  reads it. A Mach-O object with `SUBSECTIONS_VIA_SYMBOLS` won't let strip drop
  its FUNC symbols (they delimit subsections), so `--redefine-sym` **renames** them
  instead (`_first_byte`→`_l0`, `_add`→`_l1`) — DWARF still names them, the symtab
  no longer does:

  ```bash
  clang -target x86_64-apple-macos11 -g -O0 -c macho_dwarf.c -o macho_dwarf.o
  llvm-objcopy --redefine-sym _first_byte=_l0 --redefine-sym _add=_l1 macho_dwarf.o
  ```

  Pinned VMAs (section-relative in the object): `first_byte`@`0x0`, `add`@`0x20`.
  Same DWARF recovery + `char *` type; `load addr 0x0` is the `sub_0` baseline.

`funcstart_patterns_x86_64` (source vendored alongside as
`funcstart_patterns_x86_64.c`): built + stripped with

  ```
  gcc -O2 -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fcf-protection=none \
      -no-pie -fno-pic -fno-stack-protector \
      funcstart_patterns_x86_64.c -o funcstart_patterns_x86_64
  strip funcstart_patterns_x86_64
  ```

  The `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables` drops the helpers' `.eh_frame` FDEs (so the
  entry-discovery FDE oracle does not find them), `-fcf-protection=none` drops the
  ENDBR64 prefix (so the prologue is the bare `push rbx; mov rbx,rdi` shape), and
  `static` + `strip` removes every symbol for `widget`/`ext`. The `widget` helper's
  `-O2` prologue is exactly `push rbx; mov rbx,rdi` (`53 48 89 fb`) at the
  16-aligned `0x401130`, immediately preceded by gcc's 8-byte inter-function NOP
  pad `0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00`. That pair is the FULL upstream x86-64gcc
  `<patternpairs>` (postpattern `0x534889fb`, prepattern `0x0f1f840000000000`) but
  not a minimal-oracle shape, so `widget` is recovered ONLY by
  `--option funcstart_patterns on`. Pinned VMAs (read from the un-stripped build's
  `nm`): `widget`=`0x401130`, `ext`=`0x401170`, `main`=`0x401020`.

## PE CodeView / PDB debug record (s1_pdb PR-P0)

`pdb_min.exe` (x86-64 PE, ~2.5 KB) is a **PE carrying a CodeView/RSDS debug
record** for the PDB CodeView extractor gate
(`kuna-analysis::s1_pdb::codeview::tests::extract_pdb_min_exe_rsds_record`). When
`clang -gcodeview` builds a PE, `lld-link` writes an RSDS record (PDB GUID + age)
plus the `.pdb` path into the PE's `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DEBUG` directory — the
fingerprint a later PDB-consuming pass uses to find + gate the external `.pdb`.
This fixture carries only that *record*; the matching `.pdb` is **not** needed for
PR-P0 (it lands with the PR-P1 pass). Built freestanding (own entry, no CRT) so it
links with `clang`/`lld-link` on Linux without the MSVC CRT libs (`kuna-dev`):

```bash
# (run from a clean dir; /pdbaltpath keeps the recorded path a bare filename)
clang -target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -g -gcodeview -fuse-ld=lld -nostdlib \
      -Xlinker /entry:mainCRTStartup -Xlinker /subsystem:console \
      -Xlinker /pdbaltpath:pdb_min.pdb \
      pdb_min.c -o pdb_min.exe   # then discard the emitted pdb_min.pdb
```

`pdb_min.c` = `int add(int a,int b){return a+b;} int mainCRTStartup(void){return add(2,3);}`
(`mainCRTStartup` is the freestanding entry, so no CRT/`main` is needed). The RSDS
record, confirmed via `llvm-readobj --coff-debug-directory pdb_min.exe`:
GUID (raw 16 bytes) = `63 39 AC 61 48 FF 24 90 4C 4C 44 20 50 44 42 2E`
(canonical text `61AC3963-FF48-9024-4C4C-44205044422E`, the Microsoft mixed-endian
form), Age = `1`, PDBFileName = `pdb_min.pdb`. The GUID is content-hash-derived, so
**a rebuild produces a different GUID** — pin the checked-in binary's values as
test consts (re-read with `llvm-readobj` if you ever rebuild it).

## PE + matching PDB — the PDB-consuming pass (s1_pdb PR-P1)

`pdb_prog.exe` (x86-64 PE, ~2.5 KB) **plus its matching `pdb_prog.pdb`** (~72 KB)
is the end-to-end fixture for the PDB-consuming pass (`s1_pdb::PdbPass`, `--option
pdb on`), the kuna analog of Ghidra's `PdbUniversalAnalyzer` — the **stripped
`FUN_<addr>` → real name** recovery. When `clang -g -gcodeview` builds a PE,
`lld-link` writes BOTH the RSDS CodeView record (into the PE) **and** the matching
`.pdb` (the symbol+type streams). kuna's loader does not name functions from the
COFF symbol table, so the uniquely-named `pdb_demo_compute` is a stripped
`FUN_<addr>` *without* the `.pdb`; only the PDB `S_PUB32`/`S_GPROC32` stream
recovers it. Built freestanding (own entry, no CRT) so it links on Linux without
the MSVC CRT libs (`kuna-dev`):

```bash
# (run from a clean dir; /pdbaltpath keeps the recorded path a bare filename)
F=decompiler/crates/kuna-analysis/tests/fixtures
clang -target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -g -gcodeview -fuse-ld=lld -nostdlib -O1 \
      -Xlinker /entry:mainCRTStartup -Xlinker /subsystem:console \
      -Xlinker /pdbaltpath:pdb_prog.pdb -Xlinker /debug \
      $F/pdb_prog.c -o $F/pdb_prog.exe      # lld-link also emits pdb_prog.pdb
```

`pdb_prog.c` defines `pdb_demo_compute(int,int)` (the distinctively-named function
the rename proves) + the freestanding entry `mainCRTStartup`. The fixture's pinned
values (read with kuna's own `s1_pdb::codeview` extractor + the `pdb` crate — the
`kuna-dev` image has no `llvm-readobj`):
- **ImageBase** = `0x140000000`; **`pdb_demo_compute` VMA** = `0x140001000` (RVA
  `0x1000`); `mainCRTStartup` VMA = `0x140001010`.
- CodeView/PDB **GUID** = `A192EC48-382A-DFBA-4C4C-44205044422E`, **Age** = `1`,
  PDBFileName = `pdb_prog.pdb` (the EXE record and the `.pdb`'s own
  `pdb_information().guid/age` agree — the fingerprint gate passes).

`pdb_prog_mismatch.pdb` (~72 KB, source `pdb_mismatch.c`, a *different* program so
its content-hash GUID differs — `3395B1A2-F530-116C-4C4C-44205044422E`) is the
**fingerprint-gate negative** fixture: supplied for `pdb_prog.exe`, its GUID does
NOT match the EXE's CodeView record, so the pass rejects it (no rename). The
matching `.exe` is not vendored (only the mismatched `.pdb` is needed). `verify_pdb.rs`
proves both: matching `.pdb` → `pdb_demo_compute`; mismatch `.pdb` → still
`FUN_*`. Note that `pdb_prog.pdb` living beside `pdb_prog.exe` is load-bearing —
that IS the sidecar the default search finds — so a test that wants the stripped
names either passes `option pdb off` or copies the EXE somewhere on its own. The GUID is content-hash-derived, so **a rebuild produces a different
GUID** — re-read both with the `s1_pdb` extractor + `pdb` crate and re-pin if you
rebuild.

`tailcallsaved_i386` (~4.5 KB, source `tailcallsaved_i386.s`, `gcc -m32 -nostdlib
-no-pie -Wl,--build-id=none`) is the `tailcallsaved` witness: `classify` pushes
`%ebx` and `%esi` for a `-8` frame, and the run ending at its `jmp .Ljoin` is the
`addl $8,%esp` that discards the two arguments of the `call helper` above it, so
the two stack-pointer deltas cancel while both saved registers are still on the
stack and `.Ljoin` is an ordinary block of `classify`. `tests/cli/argument-cleanup-creates-false.json`
proves both arms: default keeps the whole function (`| 7` from `.Ljoin`), `option
tailcallsaved off` ends it at `return sub_804901d();` with a `tailcallframe:
recovered tail call` warning.

NB: a `.pdb` (MSF container) has a minimum multi-stream page-table overhead, so
`pdb_prog.pdb` / `pdb_prog_mismatch.pdb` are ~72 KB each — the two PDBs are the only
fixtures over 32 KB (a PDB cannot be made smaller). All other fixtures are under 32
KB. **Pin load-bearing VMAs as test consts** (read via `objdump`/`readelf`/the
`s1_pdb` extractor at build time) — addresses shift across toolchains.
# `push_immediate_ret_i386` / `push_immediate_ret_i386.exe`

The ELF assembly fixture and generated PE32 image are in-repo twins of
CryptoME's unpacking entry:
an ordinary unpacker call followed by `push <encrypted OEP>; ret`. The target
section is mapped but carries the witness's encrypted bytes and no function
symbol, so a correct recovery exposes the address without inventing a static
callee. The remaining symbols are negative controls for ordinary return,
argument push before a later return, stack adjustment, stack overwrite,
computed target, conditional bypass, and the two-push call-emulation shape. The
PE fixture is generated by `push_immediate_ret_i386.py`; it preserves the input
format and mapped encrypted-target behavior of the original witness.

### Mapped ELF x86 flow boundaries

`mapped_flow_boundary_32.elf` and `mapped_flow_boundary_64.elf` are synthetic
ELF images generated by `python3 mapped_flow_boundary.py` (Apache-2.0, authored
for this repository; no third-party binary input). Each has a conditional
`mov eax,7; ret` path and a `mov ebx,5` path ending at its mapped extent.
`mapped_flow_straddle_32.elf` and `mapped_flow_straddle_64.elf` append three
zero padding bytes to the same code, so the `mov ebx,5` path decodes one mapped
`add [eax],al` and then reaches a `00` whose ModRM byte is past the mapped end,
the tail shape of a real i386 image whose last instruction is `mov cs,eax`.
