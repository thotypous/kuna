//! Port of `decompiler/cpp/heritage.{cc,hh}` — the Static Single Assignment
//! (SSA) construction engine (W5, item `w5-s3-heritage`, stage S3).
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! [`Heritage`] links the [`Varnode`](crate::varnode::Varnode) and
//! [`PcodeOp`](crate::op::PcodeOp) objects of a [`Funcdata`] into the formal
//! data-flow graph (SSA form), built over multiple [`Heritage::heritage`]
//! passes.  A `free` Varnode (one not yet known to be written by an op) becomes
//! `heritaged` when a pass collects it, normalizes its size, guards data-flow
//! across calls / LOAD / STORE, places phi-nodes (MULTIEQUAL), and renames.
//!
//! The two big algorithms, both ported here faithfully:
//!   * **phi-node placement** ([`Heritage::place_multiequals`]) using the
//!     augmented dominator tree ([`Heritage::build_adt`] /
//!     [`Heritage::visit_incr`] / [`Heritage::calc_multiequals`]) and the
//!     [`PriorityQueue`] ordering (depth-keyed stacks, LIFO within a depth) —
//!     the order is output-affecting (it decides MULTIEQUAL *placement* and
//!     therefore the rendered text);
//!   * the **renaming** stack walk ([`Heritage::rename_recurse`] /
//!     [`Heritage::rename`]) — the dominance-tree walk with the per-address
//!     [`VariableStack`].
//!
//! The phi-node placement algorithm is from (preprint?) "The Static Single
//! Assignment Form and its Computation" by Gianfranco Bilardi and Keshav
//! Pingali, July 22, 1999.  The renaming algorithm is from Cytron, Ferrante,
//! Rosen, Wegman, Zadeck, ACM TOPLAS 13(4):451-490, October 1991.
//!
//! # Faithfulness notes (the load-bearing transcriptions)
//!
//! * [`LocationMap::add`] is the disjoint-cover union with the `intersect`
//!   code (0/1/2) and `pass`-min carry — the dead-code-delay interaction reads
//!   that code (`heritage.cc:34`).
//! * [`PriorityQueue`] is the depth-indexed stack array with the
//!   `curdepth == -2` "unconstructed" sentinel and the
//!   `curdepth == -1` "empty" sentinel exactly (`heritage.cc:142`).
//! * [`Heritage::build_adt`] is `heritage.cc:2317` transcribed byte-for-byte:
//!   the up-edge accumulation, the `a[]`/`b[]`/`t[]`/`z[]` recurrences, the
//!   boundary-node marking, the `z[]` boundary-ancestor walk, and the
//!   `augment[]` build with the `while (j < k)` idom-dominance loop.  The
//!   iteration order (reverse over blocks, then forward over up-edges) and the
//!   tie-breaks are output-affecting.
//! * [`Heritage::calc_multiequals`] / [`Heritage::visit_incr`] are the
//!   recursive dominance-frontier walk with the `mark_node`/`merged_node`/
//!   `boundary_node` flag protocol and the priority-queue insertion at
//!   `depth[k]` — `merge` ends holding the phi-placement blocks in the exact
//!   C++ order.
//!
//! # Cross-wave stubs (what is *not* fully realized here)
//!
//! `heritage.cc` is the most subsystem-entangled file in the decompiler.  The
//! algorithmic core above is self-contained at the W3 IR + W3 block-dominator
//! level and is ported and tested.  The data-flow *construction* surface it
//! drives needs `Funcdata` SSA-construction primitives and W4/W6 subsystems
//! that are not present in the merged tree.  Each is stub-noted at its method
//! and recorded in the porter's `losses`:
//!
//!   * `// STUB(W3-op)` — `setInputVarnode`, `newVarnodeOut`, `newUniqueOut`,
//!     `markReturnCopy`, `newIndirectCreation`/`newIndirectOp`,
//!     `opInsertBefore/After`-by-iterator, and the single-address
//!     `beginLoc(addr)`/`endLoc(addr)` location-set range.  These belong to the
//!     `funcdata_op`/`funcdata_varnode`/`varnode` waves; without them the
//!     renaming write/input creation, the MULTIEQUAL output construction, the
//!     normalize/concat/split helpers, and the `collect` driver cannot be
//!     realized.  Their algorithm structure is transcribed in comments at the
//!     stub so the wave that supplies the primitive can fill the body verbatim.
//!   * `// STUB(W4)` — the guard machinery (`guardCalls`/`guardStores`/
//!     `guardLoads`/`guardReturns` and helpers) needs `FuncCallSpecs`,
//!     `ParamActive`, `EffectRecord`, the `Architecture` stack/proto/join
//!     surface, `Override`, and `PreferSplitManager`.
//!   * `LoadGuard::establish_range`/`LoadGuard::finalize_range` and
//!     `Heritage::analyze_new_load_guards`/`handle_new_load_copies` are live
//!     against the IR-bound value-set solver
//!     ([`crate::rangeutil::ValueSetSolver`]), gated by
//!     `option loadguardrange` (default on).
//!
//! The [`Heritage::bump_deadcode_delay`] recorder anchor (the kuna restart
//! observability hook) is realized against the merged [`Override`] and
//! [`RestartLog`]: because `Funcdata` does not yet own either handle (a W4
//! stub), the method takes them as explicit `&mut` parameters — see its doc.
