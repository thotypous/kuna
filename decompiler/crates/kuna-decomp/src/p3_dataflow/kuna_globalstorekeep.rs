//! A store of a register value into a global stays where the binary makes it
//! when an operation reads that value sign-sensitively.
//!
//! `RulePropagateCopy` rewrites a marker (`MULTIEQUAL`, `INDIRECT`) that reads a
//! global's `COPY` to read the `COPY`'s input.  The `COPY` then loses its last
//! reader and dies, and the store survives only as `Merge`'s join of the
//! register value into the global: the value's definition prints as the store,
//! and every later use of the value prints as a read of the global.  A use whose
//! result depends on the operand's declared signedness then takes the global's,
//! which the output never states (`sink = a0 * 3; v2 = sink >> 4;`).
//!
//! [`declines`] keeps that propagation from happening when some operation reads
//! the stored value sign-sensitively ([`reads_signedness`]), directly or through
//! an expression C types after it ([`passes_signedness`]: `sink + 1 >> 4` is
//! as wrong as `sink >> 4`), or through an operation a later rule makes
//! sign-sensitive ([`may_read_signedness`]): the marker join this decision
//! allows is forced, so it cannot wait for the rules to finish.  The `COPY` stays
//! alive at the binary's own store, and chapter 06's `kuna_globalvalue`
//! refuses the copy-shadow join, so the value keeps its own variable and the
//! store prints where the binary makes it.
//!
//! A load is the other reader of that `COPY`: kuna's SSA gives a pointer store
//! no effect on a global, so after `gi = u; *p = k;` the binary's load of `gi`
//! still reads the store's `COPY`, and propagating `u` into it would print `u`
//! where the binary reads memory that `*p` may have changed.  [`declines`]
//! keeps such a load on the global under the same test.  A load it lets through
//! marks the value and the store, and a marked value is joined with the global
//! as upstream joins it.  Every other propagation is upstream's.
