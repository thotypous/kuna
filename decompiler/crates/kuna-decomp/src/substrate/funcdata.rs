//! Per-function IR ownership and mutation, from `decompiler/cpp/funcdata.{hh,cc}`.
//!
//! [`Funcdata`] owns the [`VarnodeBank`], [`PcodeOpBank`] and basic/structured
//! [`BlockGraph`]s. Its helpers coordinate cross-arena changes, including block
//! operation lists and the Varnode bank's read-replacement and definition lookup
//! callbacks. [`ArchHandle`] shares configuration and engine services.
//!
//! The live local map is [`ScopeLocal`](crate::varmap::ScopeLocal), and the
//! prototype is [`FuncProto`]. Variable properties, coverage and phase state
//! are maintained by the implementations below, not deferred placeholders.
//!
//! # The Funcdata impl map
//!
//! `Funcdata` is one struct with its impl blocks split by owning phase — the
//! split IS the documentation of which phase mutates what:
//!
//! - `substrate/funcdata.rs`          — construction, arenas, core accessors
//! - `substrate/funcdata_op.rs`       — op creation/mutation primitives
//! - `substrate/funcdata_varnode.rs`  — varnode creation/lookup primitives
//! - `substrate/funcdata_block.rs`    — CFG surgery + the jump-table drivers
//! - `substrate/funcdata_encode.rs`   — marshaling
//! - `substrate/funcdata_printraw.rs` — raw printing
//! - `p2_lift/funcdata_resolveflow.rs`— flow resolution (P2)
//! - `p5_types/funcdata_union.rs`     — union facet resolution (P5)
//! - `p6_variables/funcdata_facing.rs`, `funcdata_merge.rs`,
//!   `funcdata_spacebase.rs`          — variable/merge/stack tiers (P6)
//! - `p9_emit/coreaction_casts.rs`    — cast insertion hooks (P9)
