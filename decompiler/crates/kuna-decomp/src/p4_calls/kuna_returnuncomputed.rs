//! (kuna, ida) Reject a return register that carries no value the function ever
//! computed — the `undefined16 main(...)` / `return v4;` phantom.
//!
//! # The symptom
//!
//! An x86-64 SysV function with no known prototype was modelled as returning a
//! **16-byte** value, materialized by writing the genuine result to byte 0 and an
//! unrelated leftover to byte 8:
//!
//! ```text
//! char v4 [16];
//! v4[0] = v16 ^ 1;   // the real int result
//! v4[8] = v22;       // an uninitialized stack slot
//! return v4;
//! ```
//!
//! That output is not merely unreadable, it is wrong: it reads memory the
//! function never wrote. IDA Pro recovers `return (unsigned __int8)v16 ^ 1;`.
//!
//! # Why it happens
//!
//! Return recovery registers one trial per output register the prototype model
//! characterizes — for x86-64 gcc that is `RAX` *and* `RDX` — and marks a trial
//! active when its value survives ancestor-realism and is used only at the
//! RETURN. The compiler spec's output rule (`join_dual_class`) then accepts two
//! consecutive active trials as one 16-byte return, and the RETURN is rewritten
//! to `PIECE(RDX,RAX)`.
//!
//! Ancestor realism asks whether a value could *legitimately reach* the RETURN —
//! it is not asking whether the function meant to return it. Both of the shapes
//! that produce the phantom pass it:
//!
//! * a **callee-saved register restore**: the epilogue's `RDX` is a copy of an
//!   input Varnode for a stack slot the function never stores to, so the value is
//!   whatever the caller's frame happened to hold;
//! * a **clobber at a no-return call**: where the flow model turns a call that
//!   never returns into a return, `RDX` is the INDIRECT-creation standing for
//!   "the callee wrote something here", which is a statement about the callee,
//!   not a value.
//!
//! The upstream port already rejects the second shape *when it sees it* (a trial
//! formed from an INDIRECT creation is dropped unless it is first in its storage
//! class), but a trial is only checked once, at the first live RETURN — so a
//! function that reaches the restore shape first keeps the trial and joins.
//!
//! # When the decision is made
//!
//! Not at recovery time. There, the epilogue's restore is still
//! `COPY(LOAD(sp - k))` — indistinguishable from `return *p` — so there is
//! nothing to decide on. By the time the prototype is fixated, heritage has
//! resolved that load into a bare unwritten Varnode for a frame slot the function
//! never stores to, and the difference is plain. So this runs late, on the
//! already-built concatenation, and rewrites the RETURN to the half that carries
//! a value.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! A return trial whose value, at **every** live RETURN, traces back only to
//! things the function did not compute is not a return value.
//!
//! An unwritten Varnode that is a **formal input parameter** is the one exception
//! — the function was handed that value, so handing it back is a real return.
//! That carve-out is `option retinputhalf` and lives in
//! [`crate::kuna_retinputhalf`]; without it a returned pair whose high half is a
//! passthrough argument loses the half *and* the argument.
//!
//! "Did not compute" is decided by a bounded walk back through the operations
//! that only *move* a value — copies, phis, indirects, and piece/subpiece
//! reshaping — stopping at the first operation that produces one. A terminal is
//! uncomputed when it is an unwritten (input or free) Varnode or an INDIRECT
//! creation; a constant counts as computed, because returning a literal is a real
//! return. Anything the walk cannot classify is treated as computed, so an
//! unfamiliar shape keeps today's answer.
//!
//! # A value built in one return register
//!
//! The same `PIECE` appears when the function assembles a value in its single
//! return register: `((u64)hi << 32) | lo` folds into `RAX = PIECE(ESI, EDI)`,
//! and heritage splits a partly written register into `RAX = PIECE(RAX[4:4],
//! EAX)`. Each half is therefore judged against the bytes it occupies in the
//! returned storage (its register of a join, or its offset in the one register),
//! never against its own address -- an argument folded straight into the value
//! sits at its own address by definition and would read as leftover, dropping
//! the half, narrowing the return and orphaning the argument. And the high half
//! of one register is never kept alone: that would return its bits as the whole
//! value.
//!
//! # Why this cannot break a genuine multi-register return
//!
//! Two independent guards. First, the rule only ever edits a value concatenated
//! from two halves, and never deactivates the last survivor — so a function with
//! a single recovered return register is untouched, whatever its value looks like.
//! Second, a real 16-byte struct return *computes* both halves: it builds them
//! from constants, arithmetic, or loads through a pointer, and a LOAD is not in
//! the move-only set, so the walk stops there and reports computed. Only a half
//! that is pure leftover — never written, or a callee's clobber — is dropped.
