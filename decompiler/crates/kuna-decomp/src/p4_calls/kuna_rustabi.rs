//! (kuna, rustc) Keep the two-register value a Rust function returns, and connect
//! it at the call.
//!
//! # The symptom
//!
//! A `Result<u32,u32>` producer and the `match` that consumes it, `rustc -C
//! opt-level=2`, x86-64:
//!
//! ```text
//! prod:  xor %eax,%eax; cmp $0xb,%edi; setb %al; lea 0x7(%rdi),%edx; cmovae %ecx,%edx; ret
//! cons:  call prod; test $0x1,%al; lea 0x1(%rdx),%esi; lea 0x64(%rdx),%ecx; cmove %esi,%ecx
//! ```
//!
//! recovered as
//!
//! ```text
//! bool prod(uint4 a0) { return a0 < 0xb; }        // the EDX payload is GONE
//!
//! int4 cons(void) {
//!   uint8 v2; // rax
//!   int4 v3;  // edx                              // declared, read twice, NEVER ASSIGNED
//!   prod();
//!   v1 = v3 + 100;
//!   if (!(v2 & 1)) v1 = v3 + 1;
//!   return v1;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The payload the whole function exists to produce is not merely mis-typed: on
//! the producer side it is deleted, and on the consumer side it is a variable
//! with no definition anywhere in the program. Every `Result`/`Option` guard
//! downstream reads a phantom.
//!
//! # What was actually missing
//!
//! Not the ABI decision. rustc's `ScalarPair` return -- discriminant in the first
//! return register, payload in the second -- lands on exactly the storage the
//! x86-64 cspec's `<join_dual_class/>` output rule already describes, and kuna
//! already recovers it: two active output trials in `RAX`/`RDX`, the rule matches,
//! `buildReturnOutput` builds the `join` concatenation. Two *later* seams throw it
//! away, and both of them are invisible to a C corpus because a C function whose
//! first returned register holds a one-bit value is rare and a Rust `Result` is
//! nothing else.
//!
//! **Producer.** `SubvariableFlow::tryReturnPull` truncates a RETURN to the
//! logical width of the value being traced. rustc materializes the discriminant
//! with `xor %eax,%eax; setb %al`, so `RAX` is a one-bit logical value and the
//! subvariable rules truncate the whole RETURN to it -- which silently discards
//! the *other register* in the concatenation. The recovered return goes from a
//! 16-byte pair to `bool`.
//!
//! **Consumer.** `FuncCallSpecs::buildOutputFromTrials` handles one used output
//! trial and returns early on two or more ("STUB(W4 translate-on-handle)"), so a
//! call whose model asks for a register pair gets **no output at all**. The
//! INDIRECT creations that stood for "the callee wrote something here" survive,
//! and every read of the payload register after the call renders as a local the
//! function never assigns. The stub's stated blocker -- no `constructJoinAddress`
//! on the merged arch handle -- is stale: the sibling
//! `ActionReturnRecovery::buildReturnOutput` calls it today.
//!
//! # Two seams, two classifications -- and what each one can prove
//!
//! The two seams ask the same *question* -- is this register pair one logical
//! value? -- but they are not looking at the same thing, so they cannot share an
//! answer. Saying they do would be a false claim about the evidence.
//!
//! ## The producer: [`classify_return_pair`]
//!
//! Here the concatenation's halves are values *this* function computed, so their
//! shape answers the question. Asked of the observed writes at the return sites,
//! never of a size -- rustc's choice is a function of the variant layout, and
//! size does not predict it (`Result<u32,u32>` is 8 bytes and a pair;
//! `Result<Box<u64>,u32>` is 16 bytes and is returned through memory). Three
//! verdicts:
//!
//! * **`ScalarPair`** -- the least-significant half is *discriminant-shaped*: its
//!   value at the RETURN is confined to a byte (a small constant, a `setCC`, a
//!   masked flag, or a phi over those). That is the discriminant, and the other
//!   half is its payload. The recognition is deliberately on the value's known
//!   non-zero bits rather than on "a constant per path", because rustc emits both
//!   forms for the same source -- `mov $0/$1` on the branchy shape and `setb %al`
//!   on the branchless one, and the branchless shape is the common one at
//!   `-C opt-level=2`.
//! * **`Memory`** -- the half traces back to the function's own incoming pointer
//!   argument. That is the `sret` epilogue (`mov %rbx,%rax` where `rbx` came from
//!   `rdi`), where `RAX` carries the hidden return pointer and is not a
//!   discriminant. A veto, not an action: the pair must not form.
//! * **`Scalar`** -- anything else. Today's answer, unchanged.
//!
//! ## The consumer: [`classify_call_output_pair`]
//!
//! At a call there are **no callee values in the IR at all**. Both halves are
//! INDIRECT creations standing for "the callee may have written this", so their
//! shape says nothing and `classify_return_pair` has nothing to read. Running it
//! here would be reading the caller's tea leaves and calling it a classification.
//!
//! What the seam has instead is three pieces of real evidence, and
//! [`classify_call_output_pair`] is the whole list:
//!
//! 1. **The prototype model.** The `join_dual_class` output rule already matched
//!    a justified, consecutive, first-in-class register pair -- that is what put
//!    two used trials here rather than one.
//! 2. **The caller's reads.** Both halves are read out of the call (an unread
//!    trial is not active), they are distinct non-overlapping registers, and the
//!    payload half has a descendant.
//! 3. **The callee's body.** [`probe_callee_return_writes`] decodes the direct
//!    callee, bounded, and reports the processor-space writes it can *prove*. If
//!    that proof covers every path to a `RETURN` and never touches the payload
//!    register, the caller's read is a clobber and **the pair is vetoed**.
//!
//! The third is the only one that looks at the callee, and it is one-sided: it
//! can refute a pair, never confirm one. A callee containing any call, indirect
//! branch, undecodable byte, or more instructions than the budget yields no
//! proof, and the seam falls back on 1 and 2.
//!
//! **So `ScalarPair` at the consumer means "no counter-example", not "the callee
//! returns a pair".** That positive fact is not derivable at this point in the
//! pipeline: the recovered prototype of a local callee is never written back to
//! the symbol table, so a caller has no recovered callee signature to consult,
//! and the residual evidence is the same evidence upstream Ghidra ships this
//! branch on unguarded. The honest reading of the consumer half is *complete the
//! stubbed multi-trial branch, and refuse it where the callee refutes it*.
//!
//! # What this does NOT do
//!
//! It does not name anything `Result` or `Option`, does not synthesize a union,
//! struct or enum type, and does not touch emission. Its entire deliverable is
//! that the payload **exists as a variable and is connected to its producer**;
//! spelling that value as a Rust enum is a later, separate decision that cannot
//! be made until the value survives to be spelled.
//!
//! # The gate
//!
//! `option rustabi off|auto|always`. `auto` acts only when the loader's
//! source-language detection reported rustc (`Compiler::Rustc`, from the
//! `.comment` `rustc version` record, a `.rodata` signature, or a Rust-mangled
//! symbol), which the XML datatest bootstrap never runs -- so the C corpus is
//! untouched by construction, not by luck. `always` drops the language test and
//! is what the stage testcase uses, since a `<bytechunk>` carries no
//! `.comment`.
