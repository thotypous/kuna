//! (kuna) `passthrough` — a register a function forwards untouched to a callee
//! that reads it is a parameter of that function too.
//!
//! # The symptom
//!
//! gzip -O2 `gzip_base_name` is `endbr64; jmp gzip_last_component` — it hands
//! its own `rdi` to the callee and returns what the callee returns. kuna recovers
//! the callee as `char *sub_dfd0(char *a0)` in the same run, yet prints
//!
//! ```text
//!   void sub_d290(void) { sub_dfd0(); } // tail-call
//! ```
//!
//! while DWARF says `char *gzip_base_name(char const *fname)`. coreutils df
//! `dir_name` (`call mdir_name; test rax,rax; ...`) and tar's `*_diag` helpers
//! are the same shape without the tail call.
//!
//! # Why the argument is lost
//!
//! A call site's argument trials come from `Heritage::guardCalls`
//! (`heritage.cc:1444`), which registers one for each HERITAGED storage range
//! the callee's model could take a parameter in. A range is heritaged only when
//! some op of the function reads or writes it, and a register the function only
//! forwards is named by no op at all: the call gets no trial for it, so no
//! argument, so the function's own input never has a reader and it gets no
//! parameter either. Where the register IS heritaged (the function also tests
//! it), `AncestorRealistic::execute` (`funcdata_varnode.cc:2159`) refuses the
//! trial anyway, because upstream expects "active movement into the parameter"
//! and an input Varnode sitting at the call slot is the absence of one.
//!
//! # The evidence
//!
//! Only the callee can say whether it wanted the register, and the statement
//! this pass reads is the one `argclobber` reads in the other direction: the
//! callee's own RECOVERED prototype, which [`crate::p4_calls::kuna_protoorder`]
//! states for every callee `decompile-all` decompiled before its callers. For a
//! register `R` at a direct, unlocked, non-variadic call ([`stated_width`]):
//!
//! * the stated prototype has a parameter starting at `R`, and the list is one
//!   `protoorder`'s locking mode would accept as an arity claim
//!   ([`crate::p4_calls::kuna_protoorder::RecoveredTypes::arity_sound`]): all in
//!   registers, the callee's body does not read the register the next parameter
//!   would arrive in (a variadic's register-save prologue does), the list does not
//!   end on the last argument register, and it sits where the convention puts
//!   those types;
//! * the callee's own body READS `R` before writing it on some path, for a value
//!   that reaches something ([`crate::p4_calls::kuna_calleedeadarg`]'s
//!   `proves_input`), so the parameter is not a recovery artifact of the callee;
//!   a body that hands `R` unwritten to a direct call whose target takes it
//!   on these same terms (`call f; ret`) reads it too, up to three calls deep
//!   ([`crate::p4_calls::kuna_calleedeadarg::reads_through_calls`]);
//! * that read is for something other than a variadic tail
//!   ([`crate::p4_calls::kuna_varargtail`]): a callee whose parameter only
//!   reaches an argument slot the ABI lets a caller leave unset says nothing
//!   about what its callers put there -- openssh `xcalloc`'s third parameter is
//!   gcc's `push %rdx` alignment filler at a variadic call, gnulib `open_safer`'s
//!   is `open`'s `mode`;
//! * every EARLIER parameter the callee states is either forwarded here too or
//!   is one this function's own entry does not write before reading
//!   ([`no_hole_before`]): a claim the positional list can only reach across a
//!   register this function loads itself materializes that register as a
//!   parameter that is nothing -- the `overrec(unsigned long *a0,unsigned long
//!   a1,long a2)` of the `protoorder` fixture, whose `a1` occurs in no
//!   statement and whose one call site passes one argument;
//! * the caller did not set the call up as variadic (`set_up_as_variadic`:
//!   `xor %eax,%eax` before a SysV call), and is not variadic itself
//!   (`reads_the_vararg_count`: `test %al,%al` in its entry block);
//! * the value at the call is the function's own incoming `R` — the SSA input
//!   Varnode itself, never a value any op of the function wrote.
//!
//! The argument is as wide as the callee's body reads it, so a parameter the
//! callee recovered as `rdi` but reads as `edi` becomes the caller's `int`.
//!
//! Nothing is added for a callee that stated nothing: a single-function
//! `kuna decompile`, a narrowed or sharded `decompile-all`, an import,
//! `--option protoorder off`, and under `--option protoorder types` a callee
//! inside a recursive component, all leave every call as it was. Under the
//! default `cycles` a recursive callee states its list like any other, and what
//! it stated is read here on the same terms as any other callee's.
//!
//! # The mechanism
//!
//! The pass only ever adds to a list every other rule has settled. The scoring
//! of a heritaged register is upstream's, and a call left empty by it is often
//! finished by a later rule (`calleearityfwd` fills tar `sysinttostr`'s first
//! tail call from its sibling), which an argument supplied while scoring would
//! turn off.
//!
//! [`claim_untouched_registers`] runs at the end of `ActionFuncLink`, before the
//! first heritage: for a register no op of the function touches, it registers
//! the trial at each call no other call can precede ([`first_calls`]) whose
//! callee states it, and gives the CALL a read of it, exactly as the
//! locked-prototype branch of `funcLinkInput` does. Heritage links that read to
//! the function's input. The claim is recorded on the `Funcdata`; heritage
//! registers the now visible range at every other call as usual, and only the
//! function's own RETURN is kept off it ([`suppresses_return_trial`]).
//!
//! A trial on a claimed range, at any call, is never scored ([`claimed_range`]):
//! it is inactive, where the option-off run's hole-filling trial for the slot
//! starts. Left to `AncestorRealistic`, a register that reaches a call through
//! an earlier call is "killed by call", definitely not used, and `forceNoUse`
//! drops every argument after it (`noop(); twoarg(p,3)` at gcc -O2 lost the `3`).
//!
//! [`capture`] runs first in `buildInputFromTrials`: it keeps the unused trials
//! that stand on the function's own input and satisfy the evidence, and retires
//! the unused ones on claimed ranges so the sibling and body rescues see what
//! they see with the option off. [`extend_pending`] runs last in `ActionActiveParam`: a call's
//! final list, when it is a leading run of the stated one, gains the stated
//! registers that follow it, up to the first the function does not forward.
//! `ActionInputPrototype` then makes the function's input a parameter because
//! the call now reads it.
//!
//! # The tail call's result
//!
//! When every live RETURN is reached from a direct call with nothing in between,
//! every such callee states a non-`void` return in the same register or register
//! pair, and the function never touches those registers (`stated_tail_return`),
//! each RETURN gets a read of each and the function's return trial for each
//! (`claim_tail_return`). Upstream's `ancestorOpUse` refuses an INDIRECT creation
//! at a RETURN, so [`returns_tail_result`] accepts the one planted at a claimed
//! call, whose output then takes the callee's recovered return type
//! ([`tail_return_type`]). A register pair is kept whole or not at all
//! ([`keep_tail_return_whole`]). The `r0 = r0` an ARM return's mode switch is
//! injected as (`v0 = v0` on MIPS) is not a touch of the returned register
//! ([`is_injected_noop`]), so `bl f; pop {r4,pc}` hands back `f`'s result as
//! `call f; ret` does. The claim yields to a return value the function computes
//! itself in another storage class ([`returns_own_value`]): `bl f;
//! vadd.f32 s0,s16,s16; pop {r4,pc}` returns `s0`, not `f`'s leftover `r0`.
