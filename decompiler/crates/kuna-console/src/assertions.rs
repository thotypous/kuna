//! `--assert` — the one override plane an agent states facts through.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Everything kuna knows about a program it *derived*. That is the right default
//! and it is wrong exactly where reverse engineering is hard, and until this
//! module the `kuna` binary had almost no lever to correct it: `rename`,
//! `retype`, `map param`, `map return`, `map address`, `comment instruction` and
//! `parse line extern` all work in the console and none of them was reachable
//! from `kuna` (`docs/re-needs/no-cli-rename-or-prototype-override.md`).  A
//! rename that does not survive the process that made it is not an interface.
//!
//! # The directive
//!
//! One line-oriented vocabulary, keyed by INTENT rather than by phase — an agent
//! should not have to know that renaming is P9 to rename something:
//!
//! ```text
//!   prototype <func> <C declaration>       parse line extern    P4 prototype-source
//!   param [<func>::]<i> <storage> <decl>   map param            P4 prototype-source
//!   return [<func>::]<storage> <decl>      map return           P4 prototype-source
//!   name [<func>::]<symbol> <newname>      rename               P9 naming-policy
//!   type [<func>::]<symbol> <C type>       retype               P5 type-propagation
//!   typedef <C declaration>                parse line           P5
//!   data <addr> <C typedeclaration>        map address          P5 const-pointer
//!   comment [<func>::]<addr> <text>        comment instruction  P9
//!   flow [<func>::]<addr> <flowkind>       override flow        P2 flow-classification
//!   function <start>[-<end>][=<name>]      function bounds      P1  (= --define-function)
//!   readonly <addr>+<size>                 readonly             P1 code-data-partition
//!   volatile <addr>+<size>                 volatile             P1 code-data-partition
//!   bytes <addr> <hex|@file>               override bytes       P1 code-data-partition
//! ```
//!
//! [`Directive`] is the parsed form; the CLI's `assertdecl` module owns the text
//! syntax and the `@FILE` contract, exactly as `funcdecl` does for
//! `--define-function`.  Every directive produces exactly one [`Outcome`], so a
//! caller can report each one's fate machine-readably instead of scraping a
//! console transcript.
//!
//! # Where a directive lands
//!
//! The ordering is not cosmetic; it is what makes the plane work at all.
//!
//! * **Image-scoped** (`bytes`, `readonly`, `volatile`) states what memory holds
//!   before anything reads it.  `bytes` overlays the caller's own bytes onto the
//!   loaded image and so must land before the analysis commit — the plaintext a
//!   packer writes over itself is the input to every later decode, and a lifter
//!   that has already read the ciphertext will not read it again.  `readonly`
//!   and `volatile` paint a boolean property over a memory range, which has to
//!   be stated BEFORE the symbols over it are mapped, because `Scope::addMap`
//!   folds the property into each `SymbolEntry` as it maps it
//!   (`database.cc:1156-1158`) and never looks at the range again; the generated
//!   console script therefore emits these before `read symbols`, and the
//!   in-process surface — where the loader's symbols are
//!   already mapped by the time a caller can say anything — re-applies the
//!   property to the symbols the range covers.
//! * **Program-scoped** (`function`, `typedef`, `prototype`, `data`) is applied
//!   by [`apply_program_scoped`] right after the analysis commit, so a declared
//!   fact outranks whatever discovery decided.
//! * **Function-scoped** (`param`, `return`, `comment`, `flow`) is turned into
//!   decompile SEEDS by [`function_seed`] — the facts the drive consumes at flow
//!   time.  `flow` is the sharpest of them: it reclassifies the flow out of one
//!   instruction (`branch`, `call`, `callreturn`, `return`), which is how a
//!   caller corrects a function whose body the flow-follower walked out of — an
//!   indirect `call *%rdx` that never returns, a tail call kuna read as a call,
//!   a jump into a neighbour.
//! * **Symbol-scoped** (`name`, `type`) can only be applied AFTER a decompile:
//!   a local like `v2` does not exist until one has run (`rename v2 buf` before
//!   the first decompile answers `No symbol named: v2`, which is precisely the
//!   bug that makes today's `--kassert p9 naming-policy` inert).  So
//!   [`apply_symbol_scoped`] runs on the first pass's `Funcdata` and the caller
//!   decompiles a second time with the mutated scope carried across — the same
//!   shape the console's `decompile` / `rename` / `decompile` sequence has.
//!
//! A directive that names no function binds to the function being decompiled.
//! That is unambiguous for `kuna decompile`, which selects exactly one; on a
//! whole-binary run it would silently mean "every function that happens to have a
//! `v2`", so it is REJECTED there with a detail telling the caller to qualify it
//! `<func>::<symbol>`.  Rejecting is the point: a directive that is accepted and
//! does nothing is worse than an error.
