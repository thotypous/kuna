//! Shared **decompile-project core**: the whole-binary decompile loop
//! ([`decompile_targets`] / [`decompile_pulled`] / [`FuncResult`] /
//! [`render_c`]) and the four project-export artifact builders behind
//! `kuna decompile-project` (`<name>.c` / `<name>.h` / `<name>.asm` /
//! `README.md`).
//!
//! A `--stream` export builds the same artifacts incrementally: it pulls targets

//! `decompile-project` surfaces) and the `kuna_wasm` in-browser front-end —
//! moved here from `kuna-cli` so a `wasm32-wasip1` build can reach it without
//! `kuna-cli`'s subprocess machinery.  The callers keep their own argument
//! parsing / program loading (`load_program` / `resolve_targets` stay in
