//! Port of `decompiler/cpp/ifacedecomp.{hh,cc}` (W9) — the decompiler-specific
//! console commands.
//!
//! This is the `IfaceDecompCommand` family: every command the interactive
//! `decomp_dbg` console and the XML datatest runner (`decomp_test_dbg`) drive
//! against the decompiler engine.  The framework they plug into
//! ([`IfaceStatus`], `IfaceCommand`, [`IfaceCommandAction`], the "base"
//! module commands `quit`/`echo`/`openfile`/...) is ported in `interface.rs`;
//! this module ports the `"decompile"`-module commands and the
//! `IfaceDecompCapability::registerCommands` registration
//! ([`register_decomp_commands`]), plus the console-driver
//! [`execute`]/[`mainloop`] dispatch.
//!
//! # Shape of the port
//!
//! In C++ each `Ifc*` command is a subclass of `IfaceDecompCommand`, holds a
//! back-pointer to the owning `IfaceStatus` (`status`) and to the shared
//! per-module data (`dcp`, an [`IfaceDecompData`]), set by `setData`, and
//! mutates them from a `void execute(istream&)`.  The kuna framework passes
//! `&mut IfaceStatus` to [`IfaceCommandAction::execute`] directly (no stored
//! back-pointer — see `interface.rs`), and the shared [`IfaceDecompData`] lives
//! in the [`IfaceStatus::get_data_mut`] datamap under the module name
//! `"decompile"`.  Each command therefore opens with [`dcp_mut`] to reach the
//! shared data, exactly mirroring `dcp->...` in C++.
//!
//! `module()` returns `"decompile"` for every command (C++
//! `IfaceDecompCommand::getModule`), and `create_data()` returns a fresh
//! [`IfaceDecompData`] (C++ `createData`).  Per `IfaceStatus::register_com`,
//! `create_data()` is invoked exactly once — on the first command registered
//! for the module — so the whole family shares one [`IfaceDecompData`], matching
//! C++ where `registerCom` creates the `IfaceData` only when the module is first
//! seen.
//!
//! # Exact console text
//!
//! The command **token sequences** (`registerCom(... ,"map","address")` etc.),
//! the prefix-expansion they feed, the per-command diagnostic strings
//! (`"No function selected"`, `"Decompiling <name>"`, `"Successfully ..."`,
//! ...), and the [`execute`] exception→prefix grammar (`"Command parsing error:
//! "`, `"Execution error: "`, ...) are byte-faithful to C++: they are what the
//! Python harness (`kuna/run_tests.py`) and the datatest `<stringmatch>`
//! assertions parse.
//!
//! # Documented losses (engine integration not yet exposed by W1–W8)
//!
//! The merged `rust-port` tree delivers the decompiler engine *internals* (lift,
//! flow, SSA, the universalAction pipeline, the print stack) as building blocks,
//! but the **`Architecture`-level integration layer** the engine-touching
//! commands invoke is not yet ported into the kuna-decomp public surface:
//!
//! - `parse_machaddr` / `parse_varnode` (the console address/varnode grammar,
//!   `pcodeparse.cc`), `parse_C` / `parse_type` / `parse_protopieces` (the
//!   C-declaration grammar, `grammar.cc`) — no ported entry points exist.
//! - `Architecture::print` (the owned `PrintLanguage`, used by `print C` /
//!   `docFunction` / `docAllGlobals`), `Architecture::types` (the `TypeFactory`
//!   accessor), `Architecture::loader` (the `LoadImage`), `Architecture::context`
//!   (the `ContextDatabase`) are not exposed as fields/accessors on the merged
//!   `Architecture`.
//! - `Architecture` does not yet implement `ArchOptionContext`, so even
//!   `OptionDatabase::set` cannot run against the real architecture.
//! - The full decompile drive (`allacts.getCurrent()->reset/perform`) and the
//!   loader-backed function load (`followFlow`) are not assembled at the
//!   `Architecture` level.
//!
//! Each command below ports faithfully every part that *is* expressible against
//! the merged API — the registration token set, the argument-parse order and
//! its `IfaceParseError`s, the `dcp->conf`/`dcp->fd` null guards and their
//! exact `IfaceExecutionError` text, and the success/echo text — and routes the
//! remaining engine call through [`engine_unavailable`], whose message names the
//! exact missing C++ entry point.  When the integration layer lands (a later
//! W-item that adds `print`/`types`/`loader`/`ArchOptionContext` to
//! `Architecture`), each `engine_unavailable` site is the single place to wire
//! the real call; the surrounding faithful structure does not change.
